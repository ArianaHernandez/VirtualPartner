707,Nice~ Can’t believe u get to work straight after college lol
707,Thought they r the same? O_O?
707,I traced the IP…
707,Ya. I’m only saying I’m looking it up.
707,U don’t care anyways lol.
707,Nothing recent.
707,Oh and also!
707,"You have a better sense of who we are now, MC?"
707,Doubted you’d do it urself.
707,Oh. U already said lol.
707,Do u have that person’s username or chat record?
707,I made it impossible to log in without setting a username.
707,Nothing’s in the log…
707,It’s mandatory to set a username so he must have set it that way.
707,Anyways.
707,I should trace the person who distributed the app.
707,The evil mastermind.
707,I told him everything through the phone.
707,Uhm. Sorry but…
707,I can’t tell you that.
707,Not even her immediate family can go.
707,"Yup. That’s true, but also I’m the one who developed this app."
707,So then that ‘Unknown’ person…
707,Hosting parties?
707,But still…
707,Owner of the phone?
707,You were phished lol
707,had the person ‘Unknown’ convince u to go to the apartment.
707,Lol excited because she’s a girl?
707,"Ya. If you don’t cooperate, we can all team up to put u in trouble."
707,"First, we all know that u trespassed on the apartment^^"
707,Thank you for ur cooperation.
707,MC has to know this anyways…
707,I guess ur busy right now. Ur replies are really late.
707,Glad there’s a use for them lol
707,I created this chatroom lol.
707,Uhm. How do you know she’s pretty? I didn’t even send the photo. 
707,Ya. I have to register her before she changes her mind.
707,Good. I’ve registered her as a member! Oh. We don’t really need ur signature.
707,^^… Since it’s a verbal contract.
707,I’m gonna leave for a sec. Need to check sth.
707,How do u know how much I get paid?
707,Oh lol. Did u like the photo?
707,lol take the subway.
707,Knew it lol.
707,I want to see her~
707,…That was a bit too much.
707,Ya? She’s not picky with me.
707,"Alright, so all I have to do is hang around with this security guard and then go in lol. Okie dokie."
707,Nah~ I love everyone.
707,You don’t have to be careful of me haha
707,Wow! Ur like the only one who gets me in this group.
707,Ur cat is alive and well haha
707,Why can’t anyone recognize the love inside of me?
707,What’s that?
707,"Well, I had no choice because it was top secret."
707,Wow! She thinks I’m funny.
707,"Ya. But it was just once, and I don’t even remember where it is now~"
707,I just went to install AP…
707,I dunno about any secrets~
707,Don’t fear me.
707,Okay. Hope u make the right decision~
707,I can’t change how u think.
707,Ok. I will make an exception and let you in on some info.
707,She must be reading this conversation through her smartphone.
707,"That’s enough, right?"
707,"Ok, I don’t."
707,As always~
707,I can’t help it tho T_T
707,Why would the information be called ‘classified’?
707,I have to leave now. Just got more work~
707,Glad you came lol
707,That was a bit disgusting just now.
707,Ur hard to beat…MC…ugh.
707,Can’t believe someone beat me…T_T
707,…Is it that?
707,Hmm… If u and my Star Wars lego spaceship both drown
707,then I will shout to u to get on that spaceship and escape.
707,Maybe that’s why?.
707,Maybe I should kidnap her ^^
707,Hmm. How did I?
707,I don’t know lol
707,What? They r?
707,"To be honest, what I was thinking was…"
707,I can’t get that thought out of my head.
707,If only I could give up my life to get her to come back…
707,It would be nice if only I could do that.
707,She did more good to the world than I would ever do.
707,but I don’t think so.
707,I really want to find that person.
707,so I made this enormous sacrifice for everyone lolol
707,"My company said that it would be fun, so I did it."
707,It was pretty fun lolol
707,"Anyways,"
707,If anything happens…
707,please come to this chatroom.
707,Don’t suddenly disappear or anything like that. ^^
707,I’m the one to thank u for listening to me.
707,I was just too busy in the morning to log in…
707,I guess he missed me lol
707,I’m sure I’ll get close with u soon lol
707,I didn’t lol. U can look at the chat history.
707,You mean you sneeze lol achew achew
707,lololol which do u hate more lolol
707,lololol u still haven’t gotten over ur fur allergy? lolol
707,Dunno. Don’t remember.
707,U don’t know car poor? Car hobo.
707,I heard they have a lot of money meow~
707,U want to know?
707,Get it on you two.
707,lolol I get to talk with MC.
707,Then so many fun things will happen~~
707,But they’ll be forced to give me a holiday.
707,So excited to see the boss’ angry face.
707,…It just means I’m ditching work for a week without asking ^^
707,Why~
707,that says it all.
707,I hope it’s soon.
707,It’s being delayed because of security issues.
707,Who the hell would do that.
707,I don’t know how it’s gonna play out…
707,"And the law says that work hours are from 00 to 24, right?"
707,Since he can take care of things without hearing her voice?
707,lololol love the honesty
707,Maybe u have zero interest?
707,"Well, they aren’t really on good terms…"
707,Now that I think about it…
707,I don’t know…
707,He wasn’t… exactly well.
707,"Even now,"
707,Endless misunderstandings
707,If u get older…
707,u become more numb to things like that.
707,I feel that he may be hiding something
707,but I don’t think that he’s changed a lot.
707,That’s what I’m doing right now.
707,That’s nothing new~.
707,I did try tracing him…
707,but didn’t find much.
707,But to be honest…
707,It’s not really about that…
707,I kept digging and it seemed…
707,to be related to a religious organization.
707,I was about to look into it more… but I’m just going to keep an eye out for now.
707,"Nah, that’ll never happen."
707,"Okay, I’ll keep that in mind."
707,I’ll have to collect more data.
707,The information isn’t conclusive yet so don’t overreact.
707,lol nothing’s hard~ it’s dine.
707,Mehhh~~
707,Just kidding~ lol
707,She’s ur fan.
707,He’s denying what she’s trying so hard to make clear.
707,Can I ask u a question?
707,What kind of a woman do you think would suit me?
707,Sorry lololol
707,Alien…
707,Someone brave!
707,Don’t u dare ignore a woman’s sixth sense yo
707,Coreana sitting across from next next next to me said so yo
707,Maybe u r foolish
707,The absolute truth is that
707,all women who care for looks will definitely like you lol
707,Just admit it lolol
707,U make a living out of people who care for looks lolol
707,Ur youtube views are all because of ur face lol
707,I do think that ur going to become a celebrity or a movie star soon tho.
707,I doubt u’d change~
707,"U don’t show off, u have no other passion~"
707,Ur a total workaholic lololol
707,U are a bit narcissistic but still lolololol
707,But still~
707,It feels good when more people recognize ur talent~
707,Surrounded by people The popularity!
707,Fame!
707,It’s a huge happiness to have ur name known.
707,Feeling satisfied in a small pond is ungrateful!
707,I helped u in the hopes u’d escape that small pond~! ++
707,U went super viral because it worked lolol
707,"But ultimately, everything worked out right? lolol"
707,He brought a bunch of sponsors to host a huge event
707,and u just kicked it
707,all away~
707,He just doesn’t like him.
707,Ya I think he’s jelly.
707,"Anyways, congrats on ur new role."
707,Who did u meet with? Were they fun people?
707,Who did you meet with?
707,What a powerful combination.
707,Moi?
707,Will they sign?
707,"Hmm~ If MC thinks so, we have no choice."
707,I
707,U know I read a lot of fantasy novels?
707,Yeah… I want to see more of that animal lol
707,I know that animal is not real lol
707,I’m not that stupid!
707,lolol Can’t u try looking for her?
707,"MC, u already know his taste."
707,"lolololol Yeah, find her! lolol"
707,Tell me if you find something!
707,Is anyone here?
707,"You both, plz listen to me."
707,"MC, you were here too."
707,I must have done something wrong to MC.
707,It’s difficult to say…
707,"The day I reveal top secret information, I might be gone from this world before I know it."
707,It’s a place I’m working part time as a freelancer
707,and they just lock people in for security reasons…
707,"So if I reveal classified information, they’ll probably torture me in the basement…"
707,It’s been a while since I’ve heard something like that.
707,Is that so!?
707,I am showing my vulnerability right now.
707,Save me T_T
707,I’m a nice person. Don’t say that lolol
707,We can just be friends ^^
707,"” I do not really understand what made you say that, but as someone who’s had a considerable amount of life experiences, I cannot say that I have never been in a relationship and I am not an innocent girl who has no experience whatsoever”"
707,You mean this?
707,You can’t take back what’s happened in the past! Unless you have a time machine!
707,Then it’s best not to say anything vague like that.
707,Liking someone is selfish.
707,It clouds your mind and makes you do and say things you normally wouldn’t.
707,"But the better you control that, the more control you have over relationships."
707,You can prevent any potential problems and have the upper hand in the relationship.
707,Although loneliness will follow you always (u x YOU o )
707,lololol I don’t know.
707,It says so…
707,…in the book called ‘Expert Playboy’.
707,Only because I like to read a variety of books.
707,Read it and become a playboy yo.
707,But
707,What were u doing?
707,No way. U can’t.
707,Big trouble…
707,It’s…
707,Gah… I was about to tell MC.
707,"So, I check the health reports of all the members…"
707,I’m sorry.
707,U’ve already lost trust in me
707,so u r not listening
707,And there’s a chance you might never wake up again…
707,…Don’t get so surprised.
707,It
707,exists
707,for sure.
707,Oh! That number’s nice. It’s the 10th multiple of 2.
707,According to my data
707,lol it’s nothing
707,U have to increase ur blood pressure if u want to wake up faster.
707,Ya. Dealing it wisely is the way to go.
707,Oh… I got work again.
707,Then I’ll get going.
707,U can trust me… ^^
707,Ya. I donated a lot too.
707,A group of developers… and what was the other place.
707,Anyways I donated my talent and gave some lectures. lol
707,I went to the developers meeting and gave them USBs with viruses as gifts ^^
707,Everyone will study to try to get rid of it.
707,"Ultimately, it brings good results ^^"
707,My trade & talent donation ^^
707,Oh. You did?
707,"Don’t worry, I’ll make sure he goes well."
707,That
707,is
707,because
707,omg it’s already time.
707,We’re in trouble.
707,do u have any last words
707,Ya. Hurry up.
707,I think he meant his hands are shaking.
707,"Ya. Well, something like that."
707,You forgave him. Good.
707,Not long till I refer him to a doctor.
707,That’s good for him lol
707,I think she is.
707,So nosy lol
707,Think it’s just for ur interests.
707,Why do u sound like the dean of a private school?
707,Jealous?
707,This isn’t a school.
707,U should date whoever u want to lol
707,"Right. MC, maybe you are jealous lolol"
707,I have something to say.
707,I found her.
707,I’m serious.
707,I thought u said members shouldn’t date each other?
707,I’ll tell her to send u an email.
707,The main character always comes last.
707,Without that incident
707,and the supermarket wouldn’t have seen profit go up
707,I wouldn’t have found out who broke my precious figurine
707,"No, actually never mind. This isn’t really important."
707,"Anyways, you who broke my toy"
707,are forgiven!!
707,From a gloomy life!
707,"Without a girlfriend, without games…"
707,a clean life like a potato salad without mayo
707,a life like a worn out hoodie.
707,You have been saved from that life.
707,Proof
707,"Nah, never did that."
707,Even if I become a laughing stock…
707,U would say this.
707,“Don’t let your right hand know what your left hand is doing.”
707,The moment u reach enlightenment
707,u will forever be grateful.
707,The day u realize that it’s all thanks to me
707,u’ll realize I have the heart of a parent.
707,…Said the devil.
707,No. Should I say said the angel.
707,You’re playing games again?
707,Don’t log on~ Darling~
707,I tried to hard.
707,Don’t play games.
707,Sometimes I seriously wonder
707,who’s the worst narcissist.
707,Wow! Gimme one lol
707,"I’ll tell them to contact u, MC^^"
707,Then everyone will be surprised if MC and I started dating ^^
707,Shocked
707,Should I…
707,prepare myself? lol
707,At least I’m not childish like u all.
707,Madam! Please put that taser away! That’s for torture.
707,No. But when did you come in? The gate question changes at midnight… You managed to come in!?
707,"Alright alright. You’re the boss and I’m the servant, right?"
707,Because I didn’t work.
707,Oh my god! I can’t believe I didn’t finish work! Oh no! What should I do??
707,But… I do have a prediction report saying that I’ll do really well if I get compensated with cars. Do you want to see it?
707,"Oh, right. Cancel that."
707,I was just about to say. My house is so dirty that I’m always distracted… The boss will understand once we give him a picture of my house.
707,"Since my house is like this, I can’t help but imagine decoding all the dust particles that fly around here… Huh…!? Decoding it in my imagination is making me hallucinate all the palm oil particles from the Honey Buddha Chips multiplying exponentially!"
707,"I want to eat them….! Oh, god… I see corn starch and honey particles floating around over there…!"
707,An idiot…? Aren’t you being too harsh to a genius secret agent right now?
707,"No. If you’re not going to clean, then I need to play a round of LOLOL. I’m serious."
707,Huh? What? But why dud my screen freeze…?
707,"That’s not it, meow!"
707,I apologize.
707,I made a grave mistake.
707,This is trouble
707,There was a bug!?!!
707,Sry if i surprised u.
707,"The world is drowning in bugs as sleepless nights go by,"
707,"and rather than let the sensitive one, the cute one, and the game addict meet their downfall,"
707,it is time for me to come to the rescue.
707,But right now
707,it’s an
707,emergency!!!
707,I respect everyone.
707,"Yes, move over!!"
707,We must destroy our enemies!!
707,I have a good excuse for the bug.
707,In the industry we call internet cockroaches…
707,Exactly.
707,You’re… right.
707,I don’t have clear evidence yet
707,but I think that’s the case…
707,I couldn’t believe my eyes when I first saw the log!!
707,I tightened the security;;
707,I was really shocked too T_T
707,Don’t worry. That’s not the case.
707,"There’s a record of him requesting a call on the messenger,"
707,so I think he sent an alarm or some type of message.
707,I can’t believe what’s happening.
707,He didn’t even touch the database.
707,I’m actually worried about that too…
707,There’s a high possibility that it’s the same person.
707,We’ll have to see about that…
707,But they did happen within days one after another
707,so I’ll have to think they are somehow related.
707,"Ya. It makes so much sense that they’re the same person,"
707,but we don’t have any evidence!
707,Turning on serious mode!!
707,I’m sorry that
707,I haven’t found anything yet T_T
707,I think it’s best
707,if everyone’s careful
707,I’ll look into it real hard
707,Don’t you worry!
707,I’ll prove to everyone that team play is always better than solo play!
707,The environment is important when on a mission!
707,who keeps the place clean!
707,But what do we do about MC?
707,"If I’m serious about this,"
707,I would like to go there myself
707,to protect MC if possible….
707,Thank you but
707,I can’t go right away.
707,"but,"
707,I’d rather be rejected.
707,"Right now,"
707,I’m busy working for the intelligence agency…
707,I have piles of work to go through…
707,There is a way.
707,I installed at the apartment
707,24/7 with
707,I can’t help it!
707,It’s because of work!
707,Ya. The info won’t leak!
707,is in the same position as I am.
707,I’ll never take my eyes off it!
707,So that you’re never in danger!
707,"Since we’re talking about it, I should set it up right now!"
707,can’t focus…
707,Sorry MC T_T
707,I will!
707,I’ll work harder
707,"just for you, MC!"
707,"I’d like to,"
707,That too…
707,"Anyways,"
707,and nothing strange happening!!
707,I’ve been looking at it
707,every 2.35 seconds
707,just in case something happens.
707,But just looking at the screen
707,makes me so frustrated…
707,"We even locked our eyes once, right?!"
707,You seemed to be going to the convenience store earlier.
707,It doesn’t count since I’m not physically there T_T
707,Can’t believe there’s nothing I can do…!!!
707,I can’t give you a body guard… and I can’t go...
707,I wish I could go…
707,Sorry that I can’t T_T
707,"But for some reason,"
707,So…
707,But I guess that would take a long time. T_T
707,Maybe you’d like that…
707,I’m not confident enough to send it to ur place.
707,You don’t like it T_T
707,if I have the time for that….
707,It spits fire from its mouth. Do you think the government will approve? ^^
707,For protection… that’s why I made it spit fire.
707,"Haha, it does."
707,;;;
707,"But still, isn’t it pretty?"
707,I thought
707,it would be perfect for MC
707,while making it.
707,Since both of them are cute…!
707,"Of course, you’re not a robot!!!"
707,I’ll just take it that you don’t like the design…
707,I feel like my great secret has been revealed;;;
707,B
707,U
707,T…
707,"Even if I make things like this,"
707,it won¡t help MC….
707,But that’s the main part…
707,And it also might explode because of the gas tank T_T
707,I should create a cute version that doesn’t spit out fire lolol
707,I should just work…
707,Why did I do that??
707,The more anxious you are… smell your time.
707,okie dokie
707,Is there no hope? T_T
707,I should;;
707,I’m gonna clear my head a bit
707,and come back.
707,I’ll try…
707,I’ll be keeping an eye on you even while I’m taking a break
707,so don’t worry!
707,It is.
707,Aaaargh!
707,I let MC see my consciousness splitting!!
707,I’m sorry.
707,I didn’t want you to see me like this…
707,I can’t focus.
707,"To be honest,"
707,I keep getting worried about MC…..
707,But I can’t go right now.
707,I still have more work to do;;;
707,I’m trying…
707,but why do my eyes
707,But it spits out real fire… It’s dangerous;;
707,What if something like that happens…?
707,"If MC gets hurt,"
707,I’d never be able to forgive myself…
707,It’s not a souvenir.
707,I just made it because I couldn’t focus.
707,She’s right.
707,I should stop wasting my time…
707,Worrying about her!?
707,You think…?
707,"I’m just so nervous,"
707,and feel worried
707,and wanna make gifts
707,and I can’t focus
707,and I keep wanting to turn on the messenger
707,and I want to call her!!!
707,I’m going crazy.
707,My brain is not wired to have such emotions.
707,What thought?
707,But I read Expert Playboy
707,and it didn’t mention anything like that.
707,How am I supposed to react here?;;
707,"well, we’re just playing around;;"
707,"Well, no, that’s…"
707,i couldn’t really calm down and was all over the place.
707,It just put all the parts together itself and created itself.
707,I should… but I can’t.
707,I can’t get used to myself being liket his.
707,I can’t be like this.
707,Greek Seven Mythology.
707,It’s not the time to think about this.
707,I want to live in a world where that’s possible…
707,Because
707,I don’t do things like that. lol
707,Romantic relationships are not for me >.<
707,I don’t think I make sense either.
707,Should I throw it away;?
707,Useless crap…
707,I doubt it…
707,"Well, it’s been a while…"
707,So I made a robot. Big deal.
707,I even manage the Tripter bot.
707,So I didn’t tell you.
707,Didn’t I say??
707,I just forgot after making it;;
707,My pure innocent heart
707,f
707,"Anyways,"
707,makes me feel good.
707,What are you talking about?!
707,"Now that I’ve said it here,"
707,it’s not a secret anymore…
707,I just forgot to mention it until now. lol I never tried to hide it or anything >_<
707,That exactly. lol
707,"The more people, the better."
707,"Anyways,"
707,the fact of matter is
707,Honesty is a luxury for me. lolol
707,What if I go out of my way to be honest
707,and something bad happens?
707,Oh right!
707,"I was working, wasn’t I."
707,Now once every 2.15 seconds…
707,"Maybe it’s because of that,"
707,but time seems to be flying by…
707,How can the day past by so meaninglessly!
707,But I couldn’t even get the work done for the agency…
707,It’ embarrassing T_T
707,Why did I? T_T
707,I’m sorry.
707,I feel like time flew by exceptionally fast today…
707,But…
707,I’m surprised to see that
707,"but if you think about it,"
707,He has parents who scold him
707,and can complain about them.
707,I…
707,"can’t do that, haha."
707,"It’s not like that, haha."
707,I hope I get to tell you about it one day
707,if I ever get too…
707,"I guess it’s because it’s late, but I’m not in a good mood."
707,You be careful too.
707,You might sink into the ground if you are so down. lol
707,"Anyways, MC,"
707,"don’t let your spirits get down,"
707,and don’t start guessing about me. lolol
707,Don’t be!
707,You’ll get hurt if you do!!!
707,I don’t want you to get hurt.
707,I really mean this!
707,"I tried… my best, but epic failure…."
707,I will repent!
707,So many thing happen in this world
707,and I don’t want to complicate things further.
707,"But if people start guessing,"
707,then you have no choice but to have complicated thoughts lolol
707,707 is supposed to just laugh things off and make fun of everything.
707,"Thankful that not mush is happening,"
707,"and with God deep inside my heart,"
707,Don’t be so serious about it.
707,I get comforted by the fact that there is something in this world that will never change.
707,I can’t ever desire or have….
707,what I don’t deserve.
707,lololol I really hope that’s the case…
707,Seriously…
707,What’s wrong with me?
707,"Oh sorry, haha."
707,I guess I bothered you by talking about it.
707,I must be tired;;
707,I’ll try hard not to bother you.
707,But I guess… this is still how it is.
707,"Even when I know that nothing is happening,"
707,I just feel like something dangerous will happen.
707,I…
707,I have a memory card that can’t save anything.
707,"When I turn off the engine,"
707,I have to… give everything up…
707,I wanna explode!
707,I don’t even know what I’m like anymore.
707,I feel like… even I will forget who I was.
707,I’m a bit all over the place today.
707,I feel so weird that
707,We probably…
707,won’t have a chance to go together ^^;
707,Oh right!
707,Oh yeah!
707,I’m gonna mess the hell out of them haha.
707,I should have thought better.
707,I guess I was weirder then usual today.
707,I’ll get going.
707,"Tomorrow,"
707,"As long as my engine is on,"
707,"Like a cute meerkat protector in the lonely dessert,"
707,I will guard everyone
707,with glistening eyes!
707,"Look at me, I’m saying gibberish again."
707,Got my vibe back!!!
707,Really?
707,It looks pretty cool to me...
707,"But more than that,"
707,I brought a photo that will
707,Tada!
707,Why am I the only one who gets this? T_T.
707,Do u know what that means?
707,That’s on the dictionary!?
707,I haven’t… but I want one +_+.
707,;;; Who taught you that!
707,What do you mean? lol
707,Do you think I can be such a multi-dimensional character? TT
707,Please forget last night;;;
707,Maybe you don’t know how to access your emails? ;;
707,You can see it if you go to the email section at the main menu. lol
707,f it later.
707,I didn’t too!
707,Hmm… But I did;;
707,forward it to me;
707,I’m sure you feel iffy because of all the strange things that have been happening. T_T
707,Yup. I’m busy!
707,But I can’t miss a single clue!
707,I’ll trace it as soon as I have time.
707,"I, Seven, am"
707,always ready to sacrifice myself for you
707,No address
707,No bodyguards.
707,What?
707,I suddenly thought of something to test. lol
707,I have to get going!
707,Nope. Busy.
707,"I’m ready,"
707,"but if you meet someone like me, your life will get messed up."
707,"Anyways,"
707,"you said you’re going on a business trip today, right?"
707,Have a safe flight.
707,I’ll get going!
707,Make sure to keep the door locked!
707,Promise me…!
707,I’m going to finish it. The day’s still young~. Have a positive mind and some hope…!
707,"Oh come on~ Mister~ Just wait a minute~ My delicate heart doesn’t feel ready yet~ But first, is everything fine at the apartment?"
707,Ma’am. Can I say something?
707,I can’t get things done because I’m trying to do everything all at once…!
707,Why?!
707,Yes… We do.
707,You’re right… What’s wrong with me?
707,I do.
707,But why do I have such a bad feeling about this…?
707,Something feels strange… I just feel like something will happen to MC…
707,I can’t focus. Damn…
707,I’m nervous too.
707,At how much trouble he’ll be in.
707,So curious
707,Crazy jerk???
707,feel like he’s just been terrorized lol
707,I can send you some ^^
707,Mr. Director’s always the ones who makes the decisions.
707,So I guess he always thinks he’s right and did it.
707,I think most people can’t understand his life… lol
707,What?
707,Thats the power of binary numbers.
707,"Whatever you say,"
707,I can’t hear you lol
707,oh…
707,I actually came here to talk about that;;;
707,Found who sent it!
707,Yup. That’s the point.
707,Grilled spam mail
707,Yum
707,It’s not spam…
707,I was surprised too
707,when I looked into it.
707,I tracked sender’s proxy
707,I guess it’s difficult to understand.
707,"I didn’t get it… But yeah, I think so;"
707,I… think I kind of know.
707,Maybe he’s after information…
707,but I’m worried about MC since she doesn’t have any bodyguard..
707,There’s not much I can say right now.
707,I’m sorry…
707,Please trust me and wait a bit.
707,I’ll be keeping an eye on you like right now.
707,I’mm be more attentive from now on…
707,I don’t know that too…
707,"I’ll find out more about it,"
707,so I think everyone should
707,stick with their bodyguards for the time being…
707,It is dangerous since the information is all located in the apartment.
707,Well lol My gate protects me! lolol
707,I don’t leave the house.
707,I don’t really have time to feel suffocated…
707,It’s bearable so far.
707,"Haha, I can be antisocial. It doesn’t matter."
707,Oh! Good idea. lololol
707,Ya. If all gets resolved and things go well…
707,The fact that I know their IP
707,means that I know their physical address.
707,Now that I know their address
707,I’ll have to get ready barge in there myself.
707,but I think going there myself is the best way to solve it.
707,To be honest… I don’t know how else to finish this.
707,I’ll have to make time.
707,That’s my specialty. lol
707,"If you work for the agency, you go through these things…"
707,I’ve done more difficult missions on my own. lol
707,How could I take you there when I don’t even know what’ll be there? …
707,You can’t. You have to practice your acting;
707,And you might get a new role.
707,I’ve done some similar things as an agent.
707,"No, it’s fine."
707,"You have to practice your acting,"
707,and what if you get a new role? lolol
707,That is important.
707,Then I’ll get going
707,to prepare everything!
707,I can’t afford to make any mistakes!
707,I’m in a time crunch
707,so I’ll get going!
707,I shouldn’t have accepted this client. It’s too dangerous…
707,God… I know.
707,If I put this here… okay! Finished.
707,Oh… I know right? I made another useless thing again. What’s wrong with me? I guess I don’t value my life.
707,"Yeah, go ahead."
707,I’m tired of your lectures.
707,The boss?
707,You don’t understand…. You don’t know how anxious I am.
707,It’s not like that. I just want to help her be safe where she is. She’s… important to me.
707,I know… I know!
707,Time bomb…
707,Yes. Work kept me tied…
707,Me?
707,I’m sorry.
707,I’m sorry I can’t do anything more for your safety.
707,I tried…
707,"But I left a voice message, so he’ll call me as soon as he hears it."
707,That’s… that’s what I’m most worried of…
707,"We have to be a team so that nothing like that happens, MC."
707,Please… I hope no one gets hurt because I wasn’t good enough…
707,That’s… that’s not always the case….
707,You can say that because you don’t know much about me.
707,Yes…
707,I don’t think I’ve told you much about myself.
707,what kind of work I do for the agency…
707,And dark things like that.
707,Because the work I do is nothing but dark and filthy.
707,I didn’t want to tell anyone about that.
707,But…
707,now that this is happening… I feel like I should talk about it a little.
707,Because if anything happens…
707,if anything bad happens because of me…
707,you… and all the other members
707,will be in so much shock…
707,So it’s actually weird
707,for me to say that nothing bad will happen.
707,Of course you’d feel that way.
707,So…
707,I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you this sooner.
707,The place I work for won’t think it’s weird
707,if someone dies this next minute.
707,I’m so sorry… that you got involved with me
707,when that’s the world I live in…
707,"It’s the only path I could choose, so I don’t want to whine about it."
707,But… I want you to know this.
707,"Nothing good will come out of you knowing,"
707,but I’m not a clean and bright person…
707,And
707,"since you can be put in danger because of me,"
707,we need to keep our distance…
707,"If we’re like how we are now, where we can’t meet"
707,"and you’re neither friend nor family, you’ll be safe."
707,you and me…
707,did we ever have any kind of relationship?
707,We just talked a bit
707,here in this chatroom…
707,"And of course, I enjoyed all those conversation… but even those are pointless for me."
707,I’d appreciate that.
707,Since this is all for you.
707,You know…
707,"I only tried to laugh as much as I can in this chatroom,"
707,because of the dark place I’m really in.
707,This shithole… is probably the place that suits me best.
707,"I hope the members,"
707,"and especially you, aren’t harmed because of me…"
707,but I don’t know.
707,I’ll be more careful from now on.
707,I’m sorry…
707,I wasn’t wrong.
707,If I had just let you go then…s
707,convinced him to send you away…
707,you could have just deleted this app
707,and be free…
707,But it’s already happened now
707,so all I can do is be more careful…
707,"Thank you,"
707,"but those words will have heavy consequences,"
707,so please be careful of what you say.
707,"Of course,"
707,I’ll take care of everything that’s already happened.
707,I’ll try to end it as fast as I can.
707,I’ll try harder for you because I involved you in all this.
707,"Whatever happens,"
707,I’ll make sure you’re never in danger.
707,but…
707,so things might go a bit slow.
707,"But if the agency finds out about that, things might get more dangerous…"
707,so I’ll try to take care of it as fast as I can.
707,I’m sorry for confusing you.s
707,"I’ll just go back to the Seven I always was, and come back after everything’s finished."
707,I’m sorry for being slow.
707,Please tell me
707,if anything strange happens
707,while I finish up my agency work.
707,"Alright, MC?"
707,That… that won’t happen.
707,I’ll do everything I can.
707,I really hope so…
707,I plan to finish the agency work in a blink of an eye.
707,I don’t deserve to be thanked.
707,I should be the one to be sorry.
707,I’ll come back soon. Take care of yourself.
707,But…
707,"It doesn’t taste like oil, does it?"
707,Saw it lol
707,Time!
707,Don’t take that so seriously.
707,Something…
707,something bad just happened and
707,To tell you the reason…
707,"Just as everyone thought,"
707,"work wasn’t going so well, and I felt frustrated and upset. That’s why I said those things."
707,But!!
707,more
707,than
707,anthing
707,else
707,Oh!! Knew it lolol
707,It exists.
707,I just had it last night…
707,Detonator for your sentimentality!
707,Bang bang!
707,he died?
707,I’ll have to be careful.
707,Excessive sentimentality
707,ain’t good.
707,Good point!!
707,I’ll keep that in mind.
707,I’ll get my shit together and keep an eye out!
707,Guess it’s easier to get sentimental there. lol
707,Don’t climb up the hotel roof!!
707,"lolol If it’s so pretty, then send us a photo~!!"
707,I wanna see it meow!
707,Hurry up!
707,Drum roll please!!!
707,Louder!!
707,It really makes you want to travel to the moon…
707,I see… haha
707,It’s good that you’re satisfied with reality ^^
707,Oh…! That sounds fun! haha
707,I’m always up for adventure!
707,So luxe~ Jealous~
707,people get super sentimental…
707,I wanna go to the desert some day haha
707,I love holidays.
707,I would like to take a proper one
707,once this is over haha
707,Holidays are inside my mind…
707,"They don’t exist in reality,"
707,just in my mind T_T
707,Well… lol
707,That’s what’s hard…
707,I just have to finish it as soon as I can.
707,That won’t be possible;
707,I can’t reach him.
707,I hope we can talk to him soon;;;
707,I know you must be frustrated. Sorry… T_T
707,I think he’s still abroad T_T
707,Somewhere without any service…
707,I left a voice memo
707,so he’ll call me as soon as he sees it…
707,"Ya. If you see him through the window, make sure you get him."
707,"If I could, I wish I could clone myself"
707,and just do everything at the same time…
707,Why is it so damn hard to concentrate? ;;;
707,I have a favor to ask.
707,Tell me
707,how to focus without thinking about anything else
707,Gimme ur secrets!!
707,I see…!
707,That’s exactly my state!!
707,I’m just worried about MC’s safety.
707,That’s it!
707,Wandering idiot…
707,Knew it!
707,Mr. director
707,knows how to respect!
707,"In that sense,"
707,can I make a suggestion?
707,What you said just reminded me of this.
707,I want to invite the leader of the Emotional Labor Organization “Only Cry”
707,so that Mr. Director can expand his emotional horizons.
707,I heard that “Only Cry” is super good at knowing exactly what’s troubling you
707,and helping you just burst out crying!
707,"Once you’ve exploded with emotions after meeting Only Cry,"
707,"your emotions might actually disappear, haha."
707,Yup! Good idea lololol
707,I should tell him~ lol
707,is calling for you?
707,"Oh, okie lol"
707,"Oh, you understand? I knew you’re my one and only rocket astronaut!!"
707,He left haha
707,"to finish work and come back,"
707,is what I want to say…
707,but I suddenly smell something stinky…
707,B I N G O!!!
707,"My room is super clean,"
707,so I can actually smell it more clearly.
707,"I’d like to talk more,"
707,but I have to leave before she gets here T_T
707,She’s getting closer!
707,Time to leave T_T
707,YA.
707,I’ll come back
707,after I finish!!
707,I heard someone laughing… Did you laugh?
707,That’s not the voice…
707,…I definitely heard something.
707,I guess I was just tired.
707,Agent.
707,Can you give me some coffee? The one over there
707,···Probably not.
707,This is comfortable.
707,"Alright, alright."
707,Yeah. Isn’t it our competition company that disappeared a few years ago? That small intelligence agency.
707,I am not interested.
707,How late were they?
707,What?
707,Mahababamitabul
707,Namuamitabul Hanshimbayabaramitdasi jokyon ohgo plzhelp
707,I’m trying to concentrate. Leave me alone.
707,Sariza sebisgood bullybead lifemathzhard
707,"Sariza followtehelaw neverendinglife impobentnot… Huh, she left!"
707,Hate that she’s always watching me.
707,I really feel bad about this… I’ll just check the server while she is gone.
707,"The apartment security server… server transparency ok, input output okie dokes, last activation of gate security system… good."
707,And… the special security system…
707,The numbers seem to be different. Am I seeing it wrong…?
707,"Access log…! Oh, here it is. The last log…"
707,was only a couple hours ago.
707,This has the most complicated algorithm of all security systems….
707,Someone is active all over…
707,They must all be the same person.
707,She’ll be in danger!!
707,I’m sorry.
707,But it’s that important
707,so listen to me!
707,I can’t explain in detail
707,but you’re in danger right now
707,From this second
707,Don’t ever move from the apartment.
707,Something really bad might happen!!!
707,I’ll explain when I get there.
707,I’ll go there right now so just stay still!
707,I’ll explain everything when I get there.
707,So
707,Until I get there
707,There’s a problem with the apartment security system right now.
707,I’m gonna go and fix it.
707,I’ll do whatever it takes to get there
707,so just trust me…
707,God;;
707,I’ll come back
707,so just trust me and hang in there!
707,Just don’t move.
707,Promise!
707,Sorry
707,I don’t have time to explain.
707,I’ll go so talk later.
707,Tell you later
707,I can’t talk much right now
707,I’m gonna go save her
707,I have to leave
707,Se-seven!!! Hey! Why are you here? And what the hell is in your hands!?
707,Gahh! Caught me!
707,"Nothing happened, right?"
707,I’m glad that nothing happened…
707,Thank god…
707,"As I told you before,"
707,you can’t move from the apartment.
707,I’m on my way to you right now.
707,"I’d like to explain everything,"
707,but I really don’t have the time right now.
707,"Oh… first,"
707,"Alright. I’m driving right now,"
707,so I’ll come back when I arrive.
707,"God, that was tough…. I made it, but it’s so damn hard. How the hell did they complicate my already complicated algorithm?"
707,"MC, be careful of the glass. You’ll get hurt if you step on it."
707,I hated that the agency made me go through physical training… but I guess it did help.
707,Huh? You know me?
707,No way…
707,Oh… That’s…
707,What… what happened?
707,What?
707,"Something bad happened, right? That’s why you’re here?"
707,I’m not lying!
707,That… I had no choice! It’s all too much to explain now…
707,"First… let MC go, and then let’s talk. Please? Let’s take care of this together…"
707,"You hate me right now, right? She has nothing to do with this."
707,There’s no reason to involve her in this! Don’t do something to her because of me…. Please…!
707,"…Even if I do, it’s useless."
707,Love? I guess you two were being lovey dovey when I shivered in my loneliness.
707,"That’s not it! MC, don’t move!"
707,MC! Stay still!
707,Don’t move. It’s dangerous.
707,The special security system… I restarted it and it’s only starting to work now…
707,The whole place will explode if we stay like this. Get out of here!
707,We’ll all die if we don’t get out!!
707,MC!! Right now!!
707,Good…! Come here.
707,Get out! You’ll die like this!
707,Thank god… it stopped.
707,… I feel a bit disoriented right now. Will you give me some space?
707,I don’t know… I don’t think both of us are okay…
707,God…
707,Shit…
707,You shouldn’t have found out about this.
707,"MC, I’m sorry, but please keep what happened with that boy a secret."
707,"You can forget it completely… no, that will actually be better. Since that was a traumatic experience…"
707,Because I don’t want to harm the other members.
707,"I’ll see the end to this for sure, so don’t worry."
707,I’m so sorry for putting you in danger.
707,I should… finish rebuilding the special security system here.
707,I brought my laptop and all the equipment… so I’ll stay here for that and for your protection. I don’t know what to say…
707,And… I have to ask this of you again.
707,Please.
707,You know… our secret
707,from the members…?
707,I’m working.
707,"Even if you see it, it’ll be too hard for you to understand."
707,"And,"
707,"I never really told you about the special security system, right?"
707,"Everyone will be able to read it if I write it here, so I’ll explain."
707,The special security system…
707,was implemented to protect the information stored here.
707,"Thankfully the information is safe,"
707,and so are you…
707,so I’ll have to tell the members to stop worrying.
707,That’s… nothing.
707,I can just work here.
707,Since you’re within my sight…
707,I’ll be able to focus now.
707,I’m sorry but I’m not interested in that.
707,I first have to take a look at the system again
707,so that you can feel safe.
707,"I’ll finish the work as soon as possible, so just bear with me."
707,"Yeah, that’s it."
707,"Not all of it, but I’ve made temporary measures."
707,I’ll leave once I finish fixing everything.
707,"I’ll be here until I finish the work, so don’t worry."
707,It is.
707,Don’t worry. I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen.
707,I think it’s someone completely different.
707,"Oh, it’s nothing."
707,I think MC is still in shock and getting things mixed up.
707,The information may be what he wants…
707,or he can have something against one of our members…
707,we’ll have to wait and find out.
707,Yeah… but I can’t go right now.
707,"I have to make sure the special security system is safe,"
707,and I should do more research before actually going.
707,No… It’s better that I take care of this.
707,"Besides, we don’t know what will happen if we’re nor prepared."
707,She’s right…
707,We have to be careful as you just said.
707,I plan to.
707,Then I’ll come back soon.
707,"No, I’m just doing what I was supposed to."
707,I feel bad about putting you in danger.
707,I’m sorry for barging in on your space.
707,I’ll just stay in the corner so don’t mind me.
707,I need to fix the security system and I need to focus if I want to find out more about Magenta.
707,I feel better this way. I’ll just work here.
707,"I didn’t want to be alone with you like this, but I guess the intruder left us no choice."
707,but don’t feel too safe about me. I don’t have a good reputation.
707,It might be more dangerous that I’m here.
707,I don’t like it. You might be in danger if you stay with me.
707,My agency will track down this place… and take me away.
707,So you really have to take care of yourself.
707,A little bit.
707,"but I’m the only one who knows the address to this place, so it’ll take them a long time to find me here."
707,I left my car someplace far because of that.
707,That’s nothing for you to know.
707,"Don’t try to find out anything about the agency. If anyone asks, just pretend you don’t know anything."
707,"If I finish my work before I get tracked, I plan to disappear from the face of this earth…"
707,"Unless something happens, you’ll be safe."
707,"Anyways, my point is that I’m a dangerous person…"
707,So I’ll leave as soon as I can. Don’t try to get so close to me.
707,"I told you before, but this suits me better."
707,I have to work.
707,And I feel uncomfortable with you talking that way. Please don’t.
707,"If you have a sharpie, I’m all for drawing a line on the ground."
707,please be careful of what you say.
707,"No, just leave me alone."
707,That’s nothing for you to know.
707,It was a mistake telling you about him… Just forget that I even mentioned it.
707,"I’m sure you have a lot of questions, but there’s nothing I can tell you right now… Just don’t ask me anything."
707,Oh… you should never judge a person by how they are online.
707,Anyone can pretend to be brighter online. Especially more so for people like me.
707,The reason why I hurried over here was to protect you.
707,"I have no plans to pursue any sort of personal relationship with you, so know it as that."
707,I’m sorry if you had any fantasies about me.
707,"This is who I am, so just accept it. Don’t try to get close to me."
707,I’m going to start working now so don’t bother me.
707,I don’t have time to joke around…
707,For now.
707,I read what you said last night.
707,About revealing the address for this place…
707,In my opinion…
707,"we shouldn’t reveal it right now,"
707,"but when I decide that it’s dangerous, we should reveal the address."
707,I don’t think that he’s wrong.
707,please just trust me…
707,"I’m not saying that everyone should trust me with everything,"
707,but I know best when it comes MC’s safety.
707,This isn’t the time to be talking about that right now.
707,If MC gets in danger because of me…
707,I’ll explain everything when the time comes.
707,But there may come a time when I can’t.
707,I’ll tell you when things are more settled.
707,Not now.
707,Sorry. I’m just following what I think is safest.
707,I’ve been working on it since yesterday so everything’s back to normal…
707,and I switched up all the algorithms too.
707,Well… It just gets rid of the intruder.
707,That’s…
707,It is secret…
707,"but since it concerns your safety, I think it’s time for me to talk about it."
707,The special security system….
707,is something that can get rid of the intruder and burn all the information at once.
707,It’s a bomb.
707,Let me explain.
707,That’s how important our previous guest information was… so much so that even we couldn’t handle it…
707,You’re right….
707,I will never let the bomb go off.
707,Since we’re more safe by being in danger..
707,I understand how shocked you are.
707,But you know what’s important right now.
707,What’s important is that everyone knows this now
707,and that MC won’t be in danger even if something happens to me later on…
707,"The guy came to fix our glass, so I have to go."
707,"MC, will you quit the messenger and come with me?"
707,Of course. Here’s cash.
707,I don’t need it. Take care.
707,"He’s very strange to think so, and so are you."
707,I don’t know. You’d probably know better since you were there.
707,And one more thing… can you really stay that calm? You’ve been chatting me up since yesterday… you’re really strange.
707,Aren’t you scared that there’s a bomb there?
707,I’m really curious which planet you came from…
707,"It’s nice to see you be positive, but you should always be careful."
707,I didn’t come here from a sense of justice. I came because you are in serious danger.
707,"It’s good that you’re not anxious, but please be more aware of the situation."
707,Aren’t you supposed to get angry at me? I’m the one who put you in danger…
707,I’m so angry at myself… why aren’t you mad at me?
707,you’re amazing to say that when your life is at risk.
707,"…If you’ve been chased by danger your whole life, you wouldn’t be able to say that."
707,…That’s not important. Your life was at risk as a result.
707,"I wish none of this ever happened. That bomb, and you joining the organization…!"
707,"Don’t ever download weird apps on your phone. Oh… Well, that’s none of my business."
707,I’m going to do what I can now. So you do what you can too. Just stay still and safe.
707,"I’m going to put on my headphones and work now, so don’t bother me."
707,"But still, this is too much. A bomb of this magnitude can kill everyone inside."
707,I’ll look into how much power they have then…
707,What’s wrong? Why won’t you tell me about the intruders?
707,I trust you… but still a bomb…?!
707,MC… What are you doing here?
707,I came here because I wanted to talk to everyone else but no one’s here.
707,Did you read what everyone said?
707,Then you’ll know.
707,And everyone is confused.
707,But I’m sure this is worst for you…
707,I’m so sorry…
707,"I should have apologized earlier, I’m sorry."
707,I was just a bit flustered and got defensive.
707,"I don’t know what you mean nice,"
707,but I’m trying my best to secure your safety.
707,Why are you so nice?
707,You’re not like anyone I know.
707,I hid from everyone about a dangerous device… I can’t imagine how betrayed everyone must feel.
707,"Sometimes, you have to take extreme measures"
707,to prepare yourself against bad attacks.
707,She only asked for it to protect the information.
707,She had no intention of hurting anyone.
707,You’re right.
707,It’s natural that everyone’s mad…
707,about leaving you with the bomb alone all this time.
707,It’s hard for me to stay sane in this situation…
707,I’m kind of amazed that you’re able to stay so calm about this.
707,Really?
707,"Well, that’s not bad…"
707,"Thank you for saying that, but…"
707,God…
707,"When we first talked about having you stay in the apartment,"
707,I should have been alert about the security system then…
707,But it never caused any problems…
707,"and as dangerous as it is, I thought I made it that perfect."
707,So I thought it’d be fine.
707,I was arrogant.
707,So when
707,I put you in danger as a result…
707,I’m supposed to predict everything that might happen.
707,Since I’m in charge of security…
707,Why are you so bright?
707,"Seeing you so positive, I feel like you’re living in a different world."
707,I…
707,I am so angry at myself for not being perfect…
707,"but right now, it’s important to make sure that everyone is safe,"
707,so I’m going to stop blaming myself and do what I can.
707,I think that is the best apology
707,"I can give for the members,"
707,and especially for you…
707,And I’m going to stop being arrogant and think that my system is perfect.
707,"Even if I do, it’s pointless…"
707,You don’t know anything about me.
707,So it’s not good to trust that I’ll do everything well.
707,Anyways…
707,I’ve told you before… but I plan to go there myself.
707,but there doesn’t seem to be any other choice.
707,A drive? ;;
707,"You don’t realize I’m not talking about a fun trip, right…?"
707,I don’t know.
707,and decide whether it’ll be safer for you to be with me or somewhere else…
707,"It’s personal,"
707,so I won’t talk about it here.
707,I’m so sorry that things turned out like this.
707,And I’d like to tell everyone else
707,that I’m very sorry too…
707,Let’s be more careful from now on.
707,I suppose
707,you might not be able to ever understand me.
707,So you saying that everything is okay doesn’t help me at all…
707,I know that this is frustrating for you.
707,But I’m not here to entertain you.
707,I don’t want to escape the blame
707,but thank you for understanding it that way…
707,All I wanted to do was make sure that everyone’s safe.
707,I don’t know why things are going so wrong…
707,"If everyone is disappointed in me because of this,"
707,i’ll just have to accept it…
707,…
707,I hope that’s the case…
707,I should go offline and work.
707,Call me if you need anything.
707,This means… the lan passes through here… and the device’s parameter is around 160 degrees…
707,The coordinates of the blind spot is…
707,Oh… This is a song I like.
707,This is… margin of error plus minus 0.253
707,I have to get the angle exactly right.
707,…towards the north door… target… coordinate 263-572
707,current time… recorded. Mark…
707,7 o’clock… thermal detector… parameter calculation…
707,…Blue… 7 in total…
707,Red…. Coordinate… 172-384… Mark.
707,What are you doing right now?
707,God… I don’t know if you’re just lighthearted or dumb.
707,Please listen carefully to what I have to say.
707,"You don’t have to be polite to me. You can ignore me, avoid me, even get mad at me."
707,But don’t ever get curious about what I do or the things I’ve brought.
707,"People who get curious without knowing anything, just thinking it’ll be alright… really make me tired."
707,"They don’t know how dangerous I am and how many problems I have… They just look at me and think I won’t be much, and approach me."
707,They try to open up around me without much thought.
707,Just like you.
707,But they don’t even have the ability to handle the things inside…
707,I’ve lived a complicated life ever since I was born. A life you will never understand.
707,So don’t get curious of me.
707,That’s strange. I don’t want to get close to you at all. But why do you think so?
707,I’ve already told you. We can’t be family or friends.
707,"I don’t care whatever happens as long as you are safe, normal, and alive."
707,"You must know this already. No matter how much you try to get to know me, it’s useless."
707,The ending is already set for us.
707,"So… please, until the situation is stabilized, don’t give me any attention, and don’t forgive me for putting you in danger."
707,That chance…
707,Don’t waste something like that on a guy like me.
707,I’ll take it that you understand what I mean now.
707,Did you even listen to what I just said?
707,"If you really care for me and want to help, don’t pay me any attention and just stay far away from me."
707,That is helping me… seriously.
707,e
707,Why didn’t you answer any of my calls?
707,Where the hell are you?
707,When your eyes are like that??
707,What about me?
707,What?
707,For real?
707,We used that phone less than a week ago.
707,I see…
707,…We can’t rule out that possibility?
707,"I have a bunch of questions I want to ask you,"
707,but there’s one I need to ask so I’ll ask that.
707,Yeah. I changed all the algorithm.
707,"I have the materials in hand, so I’ll send them to you later."
707,I think we should evacuate MC. What do you think?
707,"Since there are people who are after us right now, I think it’s actually safer to just stay still."
707,"Since the special security system’s been recovered, there’s no safer place…"
707,"So… ironically, it’s safest to stay under the special security system."
707,What?
707,"Yeah, that’s why I put the bomb."
707,You just…
707,Then what else?
707,What in the world are you talking about…?
707,That’s what I don’t get.
707,Why did you think that I’d rummage through this apartment?
707,Why are you suspecting me?
707,You feel really weird right now.
707,"I don’t want to doubt you,"
707,but you’re doubting me first… that’s what’s strange.
707,Are those letters that important right now?
707,There’s something more important.
707,"I don’t know if he made a mistake, or if his doubts just slipped out…"
707,"But,"
707,I really don’t get it because I know that you’d never make a mistake like that.
707,It’s not just letters that’s here.
707,There are people.
707,I’m here
707,and so is MC.
707,"Now that you’re finally in touch,"
707,the thing we should feel worst about and most worried about
707,is MC’s safety. She walked in to a place with a bomb with good intentions to help us.
707,Shouldn’t we worry most about her safety?
707,"I’ve been waiting to talk to you all this time,"
707,and finally I’m talking to you.
707,But you just…
707,came here because you got nervous
707,that I’d stop the security system and read the secret documents?
707,I did a couple days ago
707,but now I don’t.
707,Take care…?
707,"Before I meet you,"
707,there’s something I have to ask you.
707,Can I?
707,"In that ‘everything’ you just mentioned,"
707,Answer my question.
707,Don’t pretend like you don’t know.
707,"No, I don’t want to."
707,Don’t run away and say it here.
707,So that I can trust you again.
707,Is that important right now?
707,I saw him with my own two eyes.
707,Explain to me.
707,Explain why he was like that.
707,Why did he appear in front of my eyes like that?
707,why is that boy
707,"Why is that boy,"
707,"why is he doing it,"
707,when you were supposed to protect him?!?!
707,Tell me what you know.
707,Explain.
707,Say anything so that
707,I can trust you again
707,Please.
707,I don’t know..
707,I don’t know if he really lost service
707,or…
707,just wanted to avoid me…
707,"No,"
707,I don’t care whichever it is.
707,Since
707,Shut up.
707,Be quiet… How did I turn this off. Damn…
707,I said shut up!
707,I don’t want to talk to you so just fo to a corner.
707,…
707,It’s so annoying…
707,Whew… Finally it’s quiet.
707,Don’t pay attention to that right now.
707,I’m more worried because you’re so calm!
707,"I know it’s funny to say all this after I told you to stop paying attention to me,"
707,I’m not joking.
707,He told me not to open the drawer because there’s something in there.
707,An alarm will ring if someone like you opens the drawers or one of the cabinets.
707,"But I can control all the alarms, so if I want to, I can see everything… I’m sure he logged in because he heard that I’m here and got nervous about something."
707,All of us used to be great together once. When we didn’t have any secrets and things were peaceful.
707,"But until then, I need some time to recover…"
707,I will some day… but not right now.
707,I don’t know what I’m blabbering right now…
707,I feel like I should shut down instead of that cat.
707,What do you mean the same bed?
707,Don’t even joke about things like that.
707,"Anyways, don’t worry about that drawer. I’ll take care of it."
707,"MC, you’re very innocent and naive."
707,"In this situation, I only think that you’ll be very easy for other to manipulate and exploit"
707,You’re free to think what you want… but son’t care about me.
707,And don’t even mention that name.
707,You’ll only be in danger by staying in some place like this.
707,I’m telling you this because I know much more than you do.
707,You are free to do whatever you want… but my thoughts will not change.
707,I’m amazed that you can still manage to have such naive thoughts.
707,"To repeat myself, that will never happen so don’t develop personal feelings for me."
707,"Even if you try to get involved with me, I will refuse everything. This is nothing for a person like you to be involved in.. You’ll only end up getting hurt."
707,Let’s just stop talking about this.
707,"For now on, if I have to tell you anything concerning your safety, I’ll do it through the messenger… so just know it as that."
707,I’m going to go work. Don’t bother me.
707,Are you expecting me to get jealous by saying that?
707,Do whatever you want.
707,You can only cheat if you are in a relationship.
707,I told you not to bother me…!
707,"I don’t care about your feelings, alright!?"
707,Think about the fact that you’re living with a bomb right now.
707,There’s no guarantee that something more dangerous won’t happen in the future!
707,And your changes of being in danger will multiply by being with a guy like me. Do you understand!?
707,It’s not the time to go on about emotions. Just worry about staying alive!
707,How can you stay so calm…! I can’t understand!
707,If you get in danger again…!
707,Then I’ll…!
707,"Haha… You’re free to think whatever you want, but seriously… stop it."
707,So stop coming closer to me.
707,"So stop wasting your emotions on me, I don’t deserve it… It’s all a waste."
707,Damn… Don’t look at me like that! God!
707,This won’t do..
707,I’m going to out to the hallway…
707,"I’m going to come in when you’re sleeping, so meanwhile, sort out your emotions."
707,I must have hurt your feelings.
707,I had no choice… that’s the truth.
707,Closer?
707,I guess what I told you before was no use at all…
707,God…
707,"From now on, if I have anything important to say, I’ll say it here."
707,I have something to tell you regarding your safety.
707,"but I meant the last thing I said, and that will not change."
707,And this is just a suggestion…
707,For your safety.
707,Yes… I came here to do that.
707,I hope you’re not doing that to impress me.
707,"It’s personal, so I won’t go into details,"
707,"but just to summarize the facts,"
707,my parents were not people who could actually be parents to us.
707,He gave me the opportunity to start working for an intelligence agency and be independent when I was in middle school.
707,Yes… he was.
707,I really thought he was an angel from heaven.
707,and that I would follow him always without a single shred of doubt.
707,"I don’t know… whether he was planning to break the promise from the first place, or things just went wrong…"
707,"But a couple days ago,"
707,"If you say it like that, the members won’t even know what we’re talking about;;"
707,So please be careful about what we decided to keep secret.
707,"Anyways,"
707,Since I considered him my father for more than ten years
707,I thought there would be some explanation…!
707,"The reason why I’m telling my story,"
707,"isn’t to earn sympathy, but to tell everyone"
707,will be each to their own.
707,"Besides,"
707,"So keep that in mind, MC."
707,I want to run out right now.
707,I plan to collect information
707,and visit there myself.
707,"To me,"
707,it’s more important to do research on
707,I plan to go there myself once I finish collecting all the necessary information.
707,"You’re right by my side so you’re safe,"
707,but everyone should be worried about their safety.
707,"From now on, I will not take orders from anyone but act on my own,"
707,"and if there’s anything I need everyone to know concerning their safety, I will talk about it here."
707,I don’t care even if you can’t sympathize with my situation.
707,Just don’t get involved.
707,"MC, please be safe and cautious so that you don’t get involved."
707,I’ve said all I wanted to say.
707,You’re asleep.
707,You’re been talking all day but you’re so quiet when you’re sleeping.
707,"You’re so weird, you know that?"
707,"I must have hurt you by saying all those things, but you still managed to be bright…"
707,You can get angry at me… but seeing you reminds me of the 707 I am in the messenger.
707,You’re really like 707. But I suppose you and Saeyoung are nothing alike.
707,Saeyoung is so dark and pessimistic that he cannot be with you… I want you to know that.
707,I can no longer wear the mask of the happy-go-lucky 707. This complicated and icy person is me.
707,I want you to realize that and be disappointed. So please don’t waste your feelings on me. I’m not a fun cool person… I can put you in danger.
707,"But you’re a strange person, so you won’t understand what I say. So I think I’ll end up hurting you again tomorrow morning."
707,"No, you’re not a strange person… The one who’s strange is me."
707,So I sometimes dream about you some day accepting the real me.
707,Of course it’s a ridiculous dream… but thank you for letting me dream at least.
707,Please be less nice to me… so that you won’t be hurt when I disappear.
707,Don’t trust anyone and stay safe. And forget about me and be happy.
707,Letting me protect you… is much more than I deserve. That is enough for Saeyoung.
707,It’s going well.
707,This situation must be fun for you.
707,I guess he’s still hoping.
707,Just be careful.
707,No.
707,but this isn’t just dangerous.
707,Don’t think it’s that easy.
707,I said I don’t need your help…
707,Stop being ridiculous…
707,This is exhausting…
707,You’re seriously
707,being pathetic right now…
707,"That’s up to you, MC"
707,It’s not that simple.
707,I already decided to leave.
707,You’re right… I’m going to forget everyone here.
707,"I always told you,"
707,"that once I can be sure that you’re safe, I’ll leave."
707,It was going to be like this anyways.
707,What else can a secret agent doo?
707,I meant everything I said.
707,So don’t try to get involved with what I do.
707,It will have nothing to do with you.
707,I should have said that this would be the ending all along.
707,I am sorry to mention it so abruptly…
707,"but I’m going to disappear soon anyways, even feeling sorry is meaningless."
707,No… It’s not just that.
707,I’ve always been like this.
707,"As you know,"
707,I can never have an identity.
707,"So having friends,"
707,is only temporary.
707,I’m sorry you feel that way.
707,But I’m going to leave anyways. Would an apology mean anything?
707,They are all memories that will become meaningless to me.
707,You sort out your feelings on your own.
707,I will too.
707,It’s not just because of that?
707,What use would it be for me to explain?
707,"I’m saying the same thing, but I was supposed to disappear in the first place."
707,"No, it doesn’t."
707,You….
707,don’t know anything.
707,Where I was born
707,who my parents are
707,what I do at the intelligence agency
707,You don’t know anything about me.
707,"Yeah, you were."
707,I’m not that person.
707,I said it’s all temporary!
707,So what?
707,I only said the truth.
707,Stop it.
707,Both of you
707,would never understand me.
707,Why is this on again…
707,Damn it. Shut up…!
707,I’ll throw it away later.
707,That’s useless.
707,Just leave it. It’s useless.
707,"And I’ll be leaving soon, so just forget about me."
707,"Can’t you see that it was all a lie? The jokes, the pranks, all the laughs!"
707,How are you going to stay safe on your own? Are you even thinking right now?
707,It’s all my fault that you’re in this situation.
707,"Don’t think about me, just think about protecting yourself!"
707,You’re underestimating your opponents. You’ll really be in danger with that attitude.
707,Why the hell would you stay that? Do you want to be in danger?
707,Is that what you really think?
707,Your whole life will be about being nervous that someone will notice you. Is that the life you stupidly want?!
707,You don’t have a care in the world regardless of what’s going on.
707,Are you even listening to me?
707,I’ve always been the outcast of society and the law ever since I was born.
707,I can never have a normal life… so don’t expect anything form me.
707,You’ll just end up hurting yourself!
707,How many times do I have to repeat myself? I can’t be with you. We can’t be anything together!
707,Everything that surrounds me… They are all things will disappear from the temporary life created by a secret agent names 707.
707,"A real life, real things I can have… don’t ever think and hope those things can exist."
707,my life can’t embraze anything…
707,You don’t know how it feels to live that kind of life.
707,Don’t be nice to me when you don’t know anything. Please… get away form me.
707,"The person you like is the 707 in the chatroom, not me…!"
707,Why are you doing this to me…?
707,I told you. Even if you say that… I can’t embrace anything…
707,My life was wrong from the beginning. It’s a life that’s dangerous and filled with lies…
707,I don’t want to involve you in that kind of life…
707,Why can’t you understand me…?
707,"MC… Don’t do this, please…"
707,I… I…
707,Why do you want to be with me when I’m so dangerous?
707,Please tell me the truth.
707,I was afraid. I was afraid that someone would get hurt because of me…!
707,My life is filled with that fear.
707,I don’t want you to involve yourself in anymore danger…
707,but why do you…
707,Why do you like me…!
707,God….
707,"…You’re impossible, MC."
707,You’re so strange.
707,I feel like I’m going strange too.
707,Why aren’t you giving up…?!
707,Why aren’t you getting hurt and abandoning me…?!
707,What are you going to do if something happens to you because of me…?!
707,I don’t know anymore…
707,Seeing you say that when I’ve pushed you away so many times…
707,I don’t know what to do now.
707,Do what you want.
707,"No matter how much I push you away, I can’t do anything about your feelings."
707,Nothing good will happen by being close to me… It’ll be too late to regret it later.
707,…You shouldn’t say that so easily.
707,Damn… Why are you saying that?!
707,Why are you putting me in trouble…?
707,I told myself I would never want to be close to someone… but you’re making me feel complicated…
707,I can’t believe that you’re getting to me…
707,God… What am I supposed to do now?
707,Alright. I need time..
707,If that’s how you really feel… just… just give me some time to think. Alright?
707,…Where did I put the blue print… The nut here… should fit bolt 42.
707,"Oh right, this fit here…"
707,Get your shit together man…
707,I’m fixing what I broke earlier…
707,"Come to think of it, if something happens and I disappear…"
707,at least he could talk to you…
707,"Yeah, things are a bit messy right now."
707,I’ll finish fixing it soon so please bear with me.
707,"If something happens and I disappear, at least he could comfort you…"
707,I was too busy fixing it to organize.
707,The AI program I installed here is similar to how I talk in the chatroom.
707,"Anyways, I’ll finish fixing it quick. Don’t mind me."
707,That you’re such a strange person.
707,"I’ve pushed you away multiple times saying that I can’t give you what you wan,"
707,but you’re not discouraged at all and still at my side.
707,I’m not surprised that you’re saying that now.
707,"You really can’t be discouraged, can you?"
707,Since we’re talking about it…
707,"you don’t say those things to other people, do you…?"
707,"You might not know, but there are a lot of dangerous men in this world."
707,"If you’re too nice, you might end up facing a lot of trouble."
707,"So, be-be careful about saying things like that."
707,No! Don’t say that ever… especially to other guys.
707,"Well, I mean… never say never, but…!"
707,"You’re aware that I’m dangerous, right?"
707,It’s common sense to stay away from dangerous people.
707,You should really be careful about saying things like that!
707,Alright… I’m sorry if it was none of my business.
707,Oh… Alright.
707,As long as you don’t say it to everyone else.
707,Ugh… I feel hot. Let’s talk about something else.
707,I don’t usually talk when I work… but because you want to I have to think.
707,Hmm… what should we talk about?
707,How about we talk about your safety?
707,Don’t you want to know anything? I’ve strengthened the security system.
707,I upgraded it but explaining that would be boring since the jargon’s complicated…
707,Ask me anything. I’ll tell you everything I know.
707,When I was young…
707,God…
707,I guess hiding it doesn’t mean anything now…
707,I’ll tell you a bit.
707,You remember that floppy disc from before…?
707,"I’ll show you what’s in there, so come here."
707,…I’ll turn it on.
707,"He could have been in high school in that photo, but never went to school."
707,He was always weak and got sick a lot.
707,I guess… we might look very different to you.
707,"Anyways,"
707,we grew up in a very complicated household.
707,…Our father is one of the presidential candidates at the moment.
707,"I won’t tell you who, since you might get in danger."
707,Since she asked for money in return for keeping quiet about us.
707,"When we were young, our mother didn’t let us leave the house. She didn’t consider us as her children, but as a tool to threaten our dad."
707,"I was healthier out of the two, so I could leave the house. When her alcoholism at its the worst, she couldn’t really walk."
707,"So she would send me on errands to go get water or medicine. Later, I analyzed her pattern and left the house when she couldn’t catch me."
707,I realized who I was then.
707,But it’s the truth.
707,I was saved there.
707,"Thinking about it now, I’m so mad that I never had a single ounce of doubt! To be honest, I missed him so much ever since we parted ways."
707,I desperately wanted to believe that someone would rescue us from that hell.
707,Even if I could go back… would there have been another way?
707,I don’t know…
707,So… she saved these photos on the disc and sent it to me in secret.
707,To congratulate my 20th birthday.
707,"Oh, I’m sorry I went on too long about this."
707,I only wanted to tell you a little bit…
707,"That’s strange, Talking to you… makes me want to talk more."
707,But I also feel bad about giving you something to remember me by.
707,Thank you for listening to my story.
707,This is funny…
707,but I want you to remember me even if I disappear. That just crossed my mind.
707,"To be honest,"
707,That’s why I trusted him so absolutely and relied on him.
707,But… absolute trust only shut my eyes and ears.
707,It won’t be easy. But will you still… be by my side?
707,You can decide when you’re safe.
707,Once you are safe… you can leave whenever you want.
707,But… thank you so much for saying so.
707,"You weren’t surprised at my bright hello, were you?"
707,I’m trying to be positive!
707,I have to be brave.
707,I have something to say
707,"I was going to call him,"
707,but the phone might be bugged…
707,so I wanted to say it here.
707,That’s not it…
707,I think I was very bad
707,"Since I live a life that’s completely void of human relationships,"
707,"sometimes the ‘other me’ pops out,"
707,and that was just bad timing.
707,I didn’t mean
707,to hurt him…
707,You’re here!
707,Dude… awesome timing.
707,Super sry about earlier!
707,That was a mistake…
707,I must be flustered.
707,I was sorry about earlier…
707,I just got too emotional…
707,and said things to hurt you…
707,I’ll try…
707,to make sure it doesn’t happen…
707,"Nope, it’s not."
707,I’m sorry.
707,You wanted to make soap with me!!
707,"Okay, thank you."
707,I will not join!
707,I’m kidding.
707,I’ll join too!
707,No… That’s another issue.
707,"Until now, I basically did everything he said.."
707,but I’m going to be independent from now on.
707,I think in that process…
707,I became really scared of the future that didn’t even come yet.
707,I became really defensive because I got so scared.
707,But…
707,Wasn’t that a super cool thing to say?
707,please support me ^^
707,I could think this way because MC is right beside me…
707,"Yeah, I feel like we played a game of finding our heart."
707,You don’t need to know…
707,I feel quite differently.
707,"Come to think of it,"
707,"I’m way past the age of not thinking for myself, haha."
707,"I came here to apologize to you,"
707,but I feel like I’m leaving with more support lol
707,"I’m going to be pretty busy from now on,"
707,doing everything I’ve decided to do.
707,I will.
707,I doubt I’ll get bored since I don’t have much time… but thank you.
707,I will.
707,I feel so encouraged…
707,"Then I’ll get going to do some work, MC…"
707,See you later.
707,I turned off the security system for a minute.
707,I think I’m ready to open that drawer.
707,Are you ready?
707,You don’t know what’s in there.
707,Prepare yourself.
707,"Alright. You can’t get hurt, so stay behind me."
707,"Then I’ll open it. One, two…"
707,It’s open…
707,It’s a rough draft of that logo we saw from that email.
707,Why is that here…?
707,It looks like an early version of that logo… Why is that here?
707,I was ready… but I never expected something like this to be hidden here…!
707,This isn’t the time to be like this.
707,But looking at these materials… I don’t think I can deny that she was involved.
707,Damn it. I don’t know what’s going on.
707,I feel like I’ll have to go there to find the truth.
707,I’ve already done enough research…
707,But… I can’t just leave you to be alone here…
707,Thank you. You’re giving me so much trust by saying that… I’ll never forget this.
707,Would you…?
707,I’m sure it will be safer for you to be with me han to stay here.
707,And…
707,So listen to me.
707,These materials… are very shocking… But I still want to uncover the truth.
707,"I don’t know what kind of truth is waiting for us… but with you here with me, I feel as if I’ve acquired some enormous superpower."
707,I don’t want you to regret ever following me. I’ll be by your side and protect you. I’ll guard you… more than my life.
707,If it’s okay with you…
707,let’s go together…
707,We’re the only ones here. lol
707,I kind of like
707,being alone with you lol
707,Don’t.
707,Do it.
707,Don’t.
707,Do it.
707,lolololol
707,lolol Then just say what you need to say and leave.
707,I’m joking….
707,I’m trying hard so that my mind doesn’t shatter into tiny pieces!!
707,I’m sorry
707,for making you worry…
707,What? lolol
707,"Reading everything you said,"
707,I could see how much you thought of me.
707,"Anyways,"
707,I have some important news
707,that everyone needs to know.
707,"It’s a bit shocking, but I have to say it."
707,"…I wish that were the case,"
707,You saw correctly.
707,I think it’s an early version of that organization logo…
707,"You’d know if you see,"
707,but that email you received earlier…
707,it’s several pages…
707,"Considering the current situation,"
707,I think our only option is for me to take action and uncover the truth.
707,but I plan to rummage through everything in this room before I go
707,I’m sure there’s some very important information here.
707,"He knows where we are, where we go…"
707,He’ll trace us without a miss.
707,Rather than hiding… she’ll be safer to go with me.
707,It’s just as MC said.
707,What I’m about to do may seem very rash to you…
707,but I’m hurrying because I don’t have a good feeling about it.
707,but I should move as soon as possible right now.
707,"At this point, everything he did… feels like an excuse to hide something."
707,"Anyways, nothing will come out of"
707,us being suspicious.
707,so I plan to leave tomorrow at the latest.
707,I’ve realized a lot of things… thanks to MC.
707,I realized how important it is that the members are by my side.
707,Once this is over.
707,…She is cute.
707,"but thanks to you, it occurred to me that I could live a life that’s about more than just being a secret agent."
707,Once we find out all the secrets… I’ll make it up to you all.
707,I think I should go.
707,I have a lot of work to do form now.
707,"MC, will you come to the kitchen? I need to pack some things and I need more hands."
707,We’ll come back later.
707,…Arrgh! God… I-it was a dream…
707,Oh… did I surprise you? It’s nothing.
707,I just had a dream…
707,"Yes, something I didn’t want to remember…"
707,Just bad memories coming up again.
707,…I’m so glad that you’re by my side.
707,Oh… did I surprise you? It’s nothing.
707,I just had a dream…
707,"Yes, something I didn’t want to remember…"
707,Just bad memories coming up again.
707,I see.
707,"Oh, I’m sorry…"
707,I was so focused that I didn’t realize I was making a noise.
707,"I’m pretty much done, so I won’t be so loud anymore."
707,First calm down…
707,and just listen to me.
707,But…
707,And she had something to do with ME at least three times a week.
707,I’d like to say that you’re right…
707,but I don’t think so.
707,I think MC is right.
707,"The ME label… is all over this year’s agenda, from beginning to end."
707,The last date in the agenda is the day she left this apartment because of the special security system.
707,A couple months before she died…
707,I think she left this agenda here as she left.
707,"If that’s true, it would be very shocking…"
707,I will never let that happen.
707,"I will not take that lightly, MC…"
707,I’ll make sure to find the truth.
707,"Since I don’t think this room holds any more secret,"
707,but I think we should get ready to leave soon.
707,No… I don’t feel pressured at all.
707,I actually think that it’s my mission to find the truth.
707,Yes. MC… let’s get ready.
707,"I thought about that,"
707,and it’s not a bad idea… but the information might leak.
707,I only want the least number of people to know for now.
707,"I respect your opinion,"
707,"Regarding the information I find,"
707,I’ll sign in as often as I can to update everyone
707,so make sure to check whenever you can.
707,"Then wish her luck, more than for me."
707,"MC, I’ll get ready first."
707,I will…^^
707,"Okay, come out to the living room when you’re ready ^^"
707,MC… I’m sorry if I sound like I’m doubting you.
707,But… this will be a dangerous journey. Are you really… ready?
707,Yes… You know very well.
707,Thank you. I really… wanted to hear that one more time.
707,"We’ll be on the road for a long time. if you’re tired, you can sleep on the passenger seat."
707,Even if it costs me my life… I swear.
707,In that sense… this… you should have this now.
707,Please just consider it as a friend. The robot’s programmed to be like 707 in the messenger.
707,Yes… I originally intended to give it to you. I’m sorry I broke it.
707,The 707 that jokes around all the time and is always bright.
707,If something happens to me… I hope this robot comforts you a bit.
707,I… I’ve never given someone such a caring gift before.
707,"I always thought of myself as someone who should be forgotten, so I thought it was pointless to give someone something to remember me by."
707,"But… Here I am, in front of you, now such a different person."
707,"I stand here, hoping to be never forgotten by you."
707,I hope he lets us return safe from this journey… so that I can give you many more gifts in the future…
707,The happiness of having a relationship with someone forever…
707,The hope of meeting a new future with someone… I thought this was a dream I could never achieve as 707.
707,You’ve brought out the new me.
707,I’ll never forget that.
707,Regardless of what truth is waiting for me… I’ll try my best to be calm.
707,Oh… there goes the alarm. I set it just before. I’ll tell you how this robot operates as we go.
707,Did you get all your stuff? Give me things that are heavy.
707,Trust me.
707,"Yes, together…!"
707,We’ve been in the car all along. Aren’t you uncomfortable?
707,Yes… it was a long ride.
707,Do you see that building in front of us.
707,All the secrets will be there.
707,You should prepare yourself right now.
707,You’ll be able to rest just after this.
707,Can you please concentrate right now though?
707,"MC, listen carefully."
707,I’m going to aim to get as much information as I can from this place.
707,"So before we go in, we have to figure out how this building works."
707,"First, I’m going to disrupt the building security system for about five minutes."
707,And then I’ll infiltrate… Look at this.
707,"The green part here is the view parameters of the security cameras. The parts in red are alarm devices. As soon as the security system is down, we’ll enter through the blue route here."
707,"Once we get in, this is the building layout. Our first goal is to go that circled part over there."
707,I found that most data transfers were coming from that location. I don’t know what the inside is like… but it’s probably going to be the information room.
707,"Don’t ever leave my side, alright?"
707,"With that encouragement, I know we can do this."
707,"I’ll make sure to be wide awake, so you just follow me right behind, alright?"
707,We can make that hope come true.
707,I want to be with you in a world where bad things will no longer happen…
707,I came to update everyone but no one’s here;
707,"Yeah, it’s tomorrow…"
707,"Still, I’ll have to give the update!"
707,We got here safely!
707,Come here for a sec…
707,We thought the same thing…^^
707,"so once the system’s down, MC and I will go in."
707,We’re going to what we think is the information room.
707,"I’m going to acquire as much information as I can, analyze it and decide what to do."
707,this is just a plan..
707,"I’ll take care of it as fast as I can, and as safely as I can, so have hope."
707,"Unlike a game, we won’t be able to restart though…"
707,If someone finds us… I’ll make sure that at least MC runs away.
707,So trust me on that!
707,But…
707,I feel a bit strange.
707,"This won’t be the last,"
707,"but coming to the messenger,"
707,I can’t help but think that
707,this might be the last thing I say here…
707,I shouldn’t have MC see me like this ^^;;
707,Yes… We will.
707,"Still, I’d like to say this."
707,"I had to meet everyone while hiding who I am,"
707,but everyone trusted me and was kind.
707,I was happy to talk to everyone as the bright and quirky 707
707,but on one hand…
707,I felt sad that I had to leave soon.
707,Thinking that the members and MC will forget me one day
707,really got to me… although I never showed it.
707,707 was always ‘temporary’…
707,"Byt from now on,"
707,everyone will see the real me.
707,"Especially, MC."
707,Do you want to know my real name?
707,Because I want all the members to know too.
707,"Once this is over,"
707,"I’m going to get rid of that name,"
707,and go back to living as Saeyoung.
707,Do you think… I can really do that?
707,Shall we go in now?
707,I don’t think anyone knows we’re here yet.
707,… This is.
707,I knew it. This is where the server is…
707,It’s a bit old but I can see that it’s been consistently upgraded.
707,A couple keys are more worn than others. This doesn’t really happen with keyboards that a lot of people use…
707,"The toggle that I brought… Here it is. First, plug it into the one that looks most important… then password… I knew it."
707,The most important information is usually the most recent one… So arrange everything in the latest order and start send…
707,It’s what I’ve always done.
707,"But if you increase the speed, the system’s going to have to work that much harder… It might get overheated so we have to be careful."
707,It’s what I do all the time.
707,I’m not proud of it. But you have to watch over the transfer process. We have to do it fast so you use 100% of the power. Then the central system might get over heated.
707,I didn’t find anything like that when I looked into it…
707,"I don’t know what to say… There are so many things I want to ask, to say."
707,No… I didn’t use you.
707,I left to help you. You’d understand if you listen to my side of the story…
707,Please.. just please listen to me.
707,Please don’t say that to MC…
707,I did not tell you lies when we were little.
707,I changed my name and became a secret agent not to just abandon you and live a good life on my own.
707,I believed that we had to part ways first and change our identities to excape our father’s eyes.
707,I didn’t make this up! It’s the truth!
707,I’m sorry…
707,"I tried to find out how you were doing even after I became a secret agent. I wasn’t allowed to, but I knew that I’d never feel okay without knowing that you’re happy…"
707,Here… Look at what’s in this floppy disc.
707,…Letting you see might be more effective.
707,Do you remember when this photo was taken?
707,What in the world happened to you!?
707,"We have to open it, hurry…"
707,I’m safe.
707,But he ran away.
707,I’m shaking right now…
707,"and I tried to solve the misunderstanding,"
707,but it didn’t work out and he ran off.
707,The door automatically locks form the outsinde
707,so it doesn’t open from the inside.
707,"We’ll get out of here safe, right…?"
707,"Yes, you’re right… no panicking."
707,I’ve been looking at the security cameras
707,and thankfully I don’t think anyone else knows we’re here…
707,I’ll just have to do my best to get out of here for now.
707,Both of you…
707,thank you for putting me back to my sense.
707,I can’t even imagine how I would have gotten through this if I were alone.
707,I’ll focus!
707,Oh… the program’s stopped.
707,It’s being delayed a bit
707,but the door will open soon.
707,She’s right beside me.
707,And she’s not hurt.
707,But…
707,I think we should leave the building first…
707,You don’t know when danger will come at you.
707,I’m grateful that MC’s thinking the same thing.
707,"I wanted to tell everyone directly, but I’ll just say it here…"
707,"First, I plan to get out of here"
707,and go to the safest location possible
707,and analyze the data I’ve retrieved.
707,I just came here to let everyone know that we’re safe.
707,I have to leave again.
707,but you don’t know when they’ll catch us…
707,Okay.. I’ll get going.
707,MC…! This way.
707,I want to believe that we’ll catch him soon…
707,Seeing that he hasn’t told anyone that we’ve gone in… he’s either shocked at what I told him or changed his feelings about me.
707,Huh…? What is this…
707,Tire marks…
707,It might be…
707,But we don’t have enough evidence to go after it.
707,"First… we have to go somewhere safe, so get in the car."
707,Why are you here?
707,Don’t say anything weird and answer me. Why are you here?
707,"I’m not even surprised… you’re with them, aren’t you?"
707,MC! Get in the car. This might be dangerous.
707,You want me to believe that? Don’t come near me. I won’t stay put if you come.
707,Who the hell are you? Reveal yourself.
707,How the hell did you know what was in that drawer?
707,He didn’t even listen to me. He just said that I was lying…
707,Why the hell does he think I’m a lier!!
707,Tell me whatever excuse you have…
707,You’re just pretending that you were attacked by the person you love and turned blind so that no one can suspect you!?
707,Say something with that noble mouth of yours you promised so many things with!
707,Calm down… in this situation?
707,Don’t give me that excuse… I hate you.
707,I won’t forgive you if you’re lying.
707,Silver lining?
707,No way those tire marks… They looked like mar car…!
707,But I know one person who has access to them.
707,vanderwood… I’m sure she’s the one who took my car.
707,You know very well. What are you going to help with now?
707,"MC, get in. We’re leaving."
707,"Oh, right."
707,"If your eyes really do hurt, just become blind. I don’t want anyone to be fooled by those sincere looking eyes."
707,We’re the only ones in this abandoned cabin
707,and we’re the only ones in the messenger…
707,is ridiculous until the end.
707,I’m sure you were really shocked
707,I’ve never ever told him where we were and he just suddenly appeared..
707,"As soon as we go back,"
707,We can’t let him read our conversations.
707,It is very difficult to get in.
707,But not impossible.
707,I have to do something
707,I’m so angry at myself…
707,Even if I have to sacrifice myself.. he has to live.
707,But… I don’t think this will go fast.
707,I’m sure that you had a hard time in the process of discovering the new me.
707,And thank you for withstanding all that.
707,Thank you for letting me know that it’s possible to live a new life.
707,"We’re in the messenger, so I won’t talk anymore about my feelings."
707,"We’ll be on the run tomorrow again,"
707,when times are tough
707,I think the program’s finished running.
707,"Since every second matters right now,"
707,I’ll go work some more in the living room.
