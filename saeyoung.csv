UNKNOWN,…Hello…?
MC,?
UNKNOWN,Can you see this?
MC,"Yes, I can."
UNKNOWN,… Finally connected. Thank god.
MC,Who are you?
UNKNOWN,I’m sure you’re surprised.
UNKNOWN,It’s not everyday you get a text from a stranger.
UNKNOWN,"I’m a bit flustered myself. I found a smartphone at the subway station, but all it had was this messenger app."
UNKNOWN,"I want to find the owner, but I don’t see any contact info or call records…"
UNKNOWN,I’ve been sending messages with this app but no reply…
UNKNOWN,All I see is an address and some important-looking numbers saved in notes.
UNKNOWN,I’d like to go there myself but I’m currently abroad…
MC,First… who are you?
UNKNOWN,Me? Oh sorry. I didn’t even introduce myself.
UNKNOWN,I’m just… a student studying abroad. I’m Korean.
UNKNOWN,"I could tell you my name, but it doesn’t really matter."
UNKNOWN,You won’t find me on search engines. ^^;
UNKNOWN,"But, anyways…"
UNKNOWN,Can you help me find the owner of this phone?
MC,I thought this app was for chatting with pretty boys?
UNKNOWN,What? Oh.
UNKNOWN,I guess you’re seeing this message because of something you downloaded.
UNKNOWN,"I’m not sure, but I think it’s an app that’s connected to the one I’m using?"
UNKNOWN,Can you help me find the owner of this phone?
MC,An address?
UNKNOWN,Yes. There’s a Korean address and a long number. I think it’s a password.
UNKNOWN,Do you mind going to the address?
UNKNOWN,That’s all that’s saved in this phone.
UNKNOWN,I know you’re surprised to have someone suddenly pop up and ask you a favor like this.
UNKNOWN,But still…
UNKNOWN,I’d appreciate it if you could help.
MC,Why should I help you?
UNKNOWN,Since you’re the only clue I have.
UNKNOWN,"I’ve been trying to find the owner with this phone, but I didn’t find any clues until now."
UNKNOWN,I would really like to find the owner.
UNKNOWN,Then God will be happy.
UNKNOWN,Oh! Sorry I didn’t mention it before. I’m religious.
UNKNOWN,Never mind what I just said. I’m sorry if I weirded you out.
UNKNOWN,Can you please help me? I’ll make it up to you if I get to go back to Korea.
MC,Uh… Why are you talking to me as if I’m your friend?
UNKNOWN,Oh. Sorry. ^^;
UNKNOWN,Living aboard makes you lonely.
UNKNOWN,You don’t have to be such a stranger too…
UNKNOWN,"Anyways, can you please help me?"
UNKNOWN,I’d really like to find the owner.
UNKNOWN,It’d be great if you could go to the address and find some hints.
MC,Why are you obsessed with finding the owner? You can just give it to the police or the post office.
UNKNOWN,Well… Normal people won’t be able to understand…
UNKNOWN,"To be honest, I have a religion."
UNKNOWN,"My religion says that you must not miss any opportunity to do good, no matter how small."
UNKNOWN,"Well, some say that it’s just being nosy."
UNKNOWN,But I’m not like normal people.
UNKNOWN,I can’t help but think about how stressed the owner might be…
MC,How can I help you?
UNKNOWN,Uhm… I’d like for you to go to the address saved here.
UNKNOWN,"I saw the street view through the internet, and I’ve been there before."
UNKNOWN,It’s an apartment in downtown. Very crowded.
UNKNOWN,"It’s really a safe place. If you feel unsafe, you can turn around."
UNKNOWN,I know the area. It’s developed.
UNKNOWN,Please?
MC,No. You’re creepy.
UNKNOWN,Creepy?…^^;;
UNKNOWN,I’m not a creep.
UNKNOWN,Haven’t you ever heard of the saying ‘you get a treat if you listen to older men’…?
MC,Fine… I’m leaving right away if it feels sketchy.
UNKNOWN,You trust me…
UNKNOWN,Thank you!
UNKNOWN,Just a sec. I’ll send you the address.
UNKNOWN,Found it.
UNKNOWN,< [Address] Clink Link >
UNKNOWN,Are you there? ^^ See. Nothing strange.
UNKNOWN,Is there a password lock on the door?
MC,Hmm. Don’t see one.
MC,Yes.
UNKNOWN,I’ll send you the digits. Try it.
UNKNOWN,< [Password] Clink Link >
MC,…Shouldn’t I ring the doorbell first?
UNKNOWN,Hmm. You’re right!
UNKNOWN,"Sorry, I wasn’t thinking straight."
UNKNOWN,Then ring the doorbell.
MC,I want to go back.;;
UNKNOWN,What? No.
UNKNOWN,"Soon, you’ll see the hottie"
UNKNOWN,Whoops… Typo.
UNKNOWN,Put in the password.
UNKNOWN,You can just leave a note. Yeah?
MC,Okay… Alright.
UNKNOWN,Good girl ^^
MC,I don’t think anyone’s inside…
UNKNOWN,Hmm. No choice then.
UNKNOWN,I guess the place is empty.
UNKNOWN,Why don’t you press the code?
MC,Uhm… Okay. I will.
MC,The door’s open.
MC,Can I just enter a stranger’s house?
UNKNOWN,You can just leave a note. I’ll give you my info.
UNKNOWN,"If something happens, you can just show my messages. That’ll do."
MC,Then… Alright.
MC,I guess I will.
UNKNOWN,Th
UNKNOWN,ank
UNKNOWN,you…

707,Nice~ Can’t believe u get to work straight after college lol
707,In this day and age!
ZEN,Lame. It’s nepotism.
JUMIN,It’s called recruitment actually.
ZEN,It’s giving a free pass instead of actually training the worker.
JUMIN,Whatever. I couldn’t care less what you say.
ZEN,What’s the difference between recruitment and nepotism?
707,Thought they r the same? O_O?
707,Confused 707 emoji*
JUMIN,It’s nepotism if you recruit a person you know and they aren’t of any help.
YOOSUNG,Oh… So you become a candidate for nepotism the same time you’re recruited!
ZEN,zen_sticker_01 … Zen emoji
707,Wait!!

JAEHEE,Nothing was out of the ordinary so I was just watching
JAEHEE,but I see something has just happened.
YOOSUNG,omg
JUMIN,Why is a stranger in our chatroom?
JAEHEE,No one can enter this chatroom without installing the private app we use… It seems someone has downloaded the RFA Messenger.
YOOSUNG,I thought Seven let only us download it?
YOOSUNG,*Confused Yoosung emoji
ZEN,Maybe someone downloaded the app on two phones?
707,Maybe?
JUMIN,Who downloaded it twice?
YOOSUNG,Not me!
MC,Hello…
YOOSUNG,Gahhhh it’s talking!!
YOOSUNG,Shocked Yoosung emoji*
ZEN,So it’s not two smartphones.
JUMIN,Who is it?
YOOSUNG,Find out what it is!
JAEHEE,How did you find out about this place? Where did you download the application?
707,Oh… ^^; Wait.
ZEN,What is it. Hurry and tell me.
707,I traced the IP…
707,It’s from Rika’s apartment.
YOOSUNG,Rika’s apartment?
JUMIN,Where was it?
JAEHEE,The location is not revealed. I know it to be classified.
707,"Anyways, someone must have broken into her apt."
707,"It talked now, so it must be a person ^^;"
YOOSUNG,"So it hacked the program, Seven?"
707,Yup
YOOSUNG,Who are you?! How did you get into Rika’s apartment?!
YOOSUNG,How did you get this app?!
YOOSUNG,Gah~ So scared right now…
YOOSUNG,Depressed Yoosung emoji*
YOOSUNG,I thought the apartment has a passworh lobk?
ZEN,Typo
JAEHEE,I assume it was a break in.
JAEHEE,"Username “MC”, I recommend that you confess."
ZEN,"Jaehee, would you voluntarily confess to everything if it were you?"
JAEHEE,No. But it is good to ask first.
707,Lolol
JUMIN,Quit shitting around.
JUMIN,MC… Who are you?
JUMIN,"Reveal yourself, stranger."
JUMIN,"If you do not reveal yourself, you will pay."
ZEN,Stranger you will pay? Lmfao
ZEN,omg~*so scary*~
ZEN,It might be a girl.
707,That’s sexist lol. U should watch what u say now that ur a famous actor.
ZEN,I’m not famous;; just a bit recognizable.
YOOSUNG,Nah~ Look at the youtube hits~
ZEN,Dude. Stawp;;
707,lolol
JAEHEE,That video is still excellent no matter how many times I watch it.
YOOSUNG,"Zen, when do you start your next piece?"
ZEN,;;Don’t know. It’s up to the director.
YOOSUNG,He’s a celebrity lol! I’m gonna tell everyone at school.
JUMIN,Hey.
JUMIN,Don’t get distracted.
YOOSUNG,"Oh, right. Username MC…"
JAEHEE,… An abrupt stranger.
707,My hands r shaking as I hack.
JUMIN,Who are you? Reveal yourself right now.
YOOSUNG,Yeees! Who are u?!
ZEN,Use proper english please.
707,If it doesn’t say anything I’ll hack in and find out.
ZEN,…Maybe
ZEN,one of my fans?
JUMIN,Angry Jumin emoji*
MC,I am MC. Who are you all and what is this place?
707,Lol so awkward.
707,I thought it was a computer talking.
ZEN,Seems more normal than I thought.
YOOSUNG,What were you thinking?
ZEN,… Nothing~Nothing.
MC,Reveal yourselves first. I’m the most confused one here…
JUMIN,How fierce.
ZEN,Are you a woman?
707,"Zen. Be more serious, plz?"
707,And wait a sec on the woman thing.
707,Looking it up.
707,Happy 707 emoji*
JAEHEE,Such a search violates privacy laws.
707,Ya. I’m only saying I’m looking it up.
707,No evidence that I’m actually hackginh.
YOOSUNG,"Seven, that’s obviously a lie. lol"
YOOSUNG,And I know that typo’s on purpose.
YOOSUNG,Still…
YOOSUNG,Won’t it tell us about itself if we tell who we are first?
ZEN,To be honest…
ZEN,I agree with Yoosung.
JUMIN,More like you want to show off who you are.
YOOSUNG,Should we… introduce ourselves?
JUMIN,Are you serious…?
JAEHEE,I think it is a bit too early for that.
ZEN,Hi. I’m Zen. (24 yrs old) Musical actor… Don’t look me up on the internet.
ZEN,It’s embarrassing.
YOOSUNG,"Zen, you’re so brave!"
JUMIN,Guess he wanted to show himself off.
ZEN,No way~!
YOOSUNG,Omg… a photo too.
JAEHEE,My eyes have been cleansed.
JAEHEE,Sparkly eyed Jaehee emoji*
JAEHEE,Wait. I can’t be like this…
JUMIN,I see that he has zero interest in his privacy.
707,Lolol
707,My nickname’s 707.
707,Real name is a secret.
707,"Fyi, Zen’s real name is Hyun Ryu."
ZEN,Your name’s a secret but not mine?;
707,U don’t care anyways lol.
JAEHEE,707 does have the strangest name so I understand the secrecy.
707, The name’s too holy to be spread around~ I’m gonna pray after I finish hacking.
ZEN, Zen emoji*
ZEN,"Pray, yeah right;;"
707,Just remember me as the 22yr old young hacker lol
707,Where I live is also a secret.
ZEN,So many secrets;;
YOOSUNG,I’m Yoosung Kim! I’m a college student… 21 yrs old.
JUMIN,I don’t know why everybody’s introducing themselves. You don’t even know who that person is.
707,So warm and fuzzy here
ZEN,"Lol. Seven, you don’t have any selfies to show?"
707,Nothing recent.
707,Oh and also!
707,Jumin’s the heir of a pretty famous corporation and Jaehee is his assistant. 27 and 26 yrs old respectively.
707,"You have a better sense of who we are now, MC?"
JUMIN,Why did you say that…?
707,Doubted you’d do it urself.
JUMIN,Stop shitting around.
707,"Oh, fyi, Jumin has the cutest cat."
JUMIN,Hey.
JUMIN,Why are we talking about Elizabeth the 3rd to a stranger?
707,The cat’s name is Elizabeth the 3rd.
707,Oh. U already said lol.
YOOSUNG,That info’s a bit useless…
YOOSUNG,We’re not even close with this MC person yet lol
JUMIN,Can’t believe he showed a photo of Elizabeth the 3rd to a stranger…
JUMIN,Idiot…
JUMIN,I know you came to my house the other day and harassed her. It’s all on CCTV.
707,My precious privacy!
ZEN,Yeah since you care so much about privacy.
YOOSUNG,CCTV screenshots omg
JUMIN,And Yoosung.
JUMIN,Is my Elizabeth the 3rd useless?
YOOSUNG,Shocked Yoosung emoji*
707,That was so funn~~
707,I want to see the cat again~
JUMIN,No.
ZEN,Stop talking about cats. Giving me goosebumps.
JAEHEE,I suggest that we take care of this stranger first.
JAEHEE,Could it be that we have a security breach?
ZEN,"True. MC, how did you get in here?"
YOOSUNG,Is it really in Rika’s apartment?
707,Yup. It’s for sure…
707,How did it get the apartment password?!
ZEN,Where the hell is the apartment?
MC,I am flustered too. I was connected to a stranger through a messenger app and he sent me the address.
JUMIN,Chatting with a stranger…
JUMIN,How naive.
ZEN,So cute lol
ZEN,Went to an address from a chatting app lolol
YOOSUNG,Don’t listen to strangers~ The world is dangerous.
JAEHEE,I agree.
707,Wait.
707,Do u have that person’s username or chat record?
MC,The username was ‘Unknown’. And the record was deleted.
JUMIN,Does the username not exist? Why is it ‘Unknown’?
707,I made it impossible to log in without setting a username.
707,Nothing’s in the log…
YOOSUNG,What’s a log? Is it a job title for online games?
JUMIN,Tree trunk
JAEHEE,It refers topast records;;
ZEN,Tsk tsk everyone’s so dumb
JUMIN,Never thought I’d hear that from you
YOOSUNG,Shocked Yoosung emoji*
707,Omg lolol can’t believe Zen just said that
JUMIN,The world must be coming to an end.
JAEHEE,Everyone please calm down. Let’s look at the situation at hand.
707,"Hmm. Good point, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Who do you think that ‘Unknown’ person is?
MC,I came here while chatting with a personal called ‘Unknown’. Do you know him by any chance?
JUMIN,Unknown?
ZEN,Maybe he just didn’t set a username?
707,It’s mandatory to set a username so he must have set it that way.
707,Maybe…
707,Shocked 707 emoji*
707,A hacker…?!
YOOSUNG,!!!
707,A hacker! No way.
707,I have everything covered!
707,"Hey, MC. So he told you the password for the door lock?"
MC,Ya. I know nothing
JUMIN,…Ya?
ZEN,Cute lol
MC,Yes.
JUMIN,I see…
JUMIN,That ‘Unknown’ person could have dragged you into this.
YOOSUNG,But..
YOOSUNG,How did you end up chatting with that person?
JAEHEE,I see.
JAEHEE,Where did you download this messenger app?
JAEHEE,"MC, you are quite strange as well."
ZEN,Do you think this person’s a creep? No way.
MC,I just wanted to chat with pretty boys…
ZEN,Me? You wanted to chat with me?
JUMIN,Completely out of his mind.
YOOSUNG,Ye.
YOOSUNG,"Oh, typo!"
JAEHEE,It’s true that Zen is good looking.
ZEN,"Thank you, Jaehee ^^"
707,Happy 707 emoji*
MC,just got it @ app store…
JUMIN,What a modern way of talking.
ZEN,So cute lol
MC,I just wanted to downloaded the game and play it.
YOOSUNG,You like games too!
YOOSUNG,I love games.
YOOSUNG,Do you know this game called LoLoL?
ZEN,Dude. A girl won’t play that game;
ZEN,Don’t ask stupid questions.
YOOSUNG,T_T
707,Anyways.
707,I should trace the person who distributed the app.
JUMIN,If what she is saying is true.
JAEHEE,I think it would be a good idea to contact V.
707,Yeah. I think that’s a good idea.
707,I’ll call and explain everything.
JUMIN,I can call.
707,Already on it lol
ZEN,Fast.
YOOSUNG,Seven seems talk to V pretty often.
MC,What is this chat room for;;?
JAEHEE,We can answer that after we have told V about this situation.
JUMIN,Yeah.
MC,Who’s V?
ZEN,V is… like our boss.
707,The evil mastermind.
JUMIN,…or not. He’s the person who has control over this chat room and the organization we’re in.
JUMIN,I hope V comes and takes care of all this.
ZEN,V’s too busy these days to come chat… We’ll get to talk to him because of this~
YOOSUNG,We’re all busy. I don’t like that V’s the only one not coming.
ZEN,Well… that’s true…
JAEHEE,V should know that MC is here so let’s just wait.
JAEHEE,"Seven, are you calling him?"
707,Ya.
YOOSUNG,But shouldn’t we tell MC what this chatroom is for first?
YOOSUNG,She has to know how serious it is that she’s here!
JUMIN,What’s more serious is that she’s in Rika’s apartment.
YOOSUNG,That’s true…
JAEHEE,I am always ready to call the police.
YOOSUNG,Jaehee’s scary T_T
JUMIN,Until we figure out who MC is
JUMIN,I don’t want to reveal anything.
JAEHEE,I agree.
707,Wecan.
707,Sorry callingvandtypingwithonehand
YOOSUNG,Type after you finish the call.
707,Lookedintoownerofdevice.
707,she’scutelol
YOOSUNG,You did a background check on her!? So MC is definitely a girl?
MC,But I’m not a girl.
707,thenwhydouplaythisgame
YOOSUNG,???
ZEN,Are you a girl or a boy?
707,youdidntreadsweetfantasyforladies?
YOOSUNG,I heard that’s just the company’s marketing scheme;
YOOSUNG,"Anyways, are you a girl or a boy?"
YOOSUNG,Confused Yoosung emoji*
707,girl
JAEHEE,Let’s just say she’s a girl.
ZEN,Oh! A girl!
MC,Where did you get that info!?
ZEN,He’s a hacker. He probably saw your fb page already.
707,notthereyet
707,iwillifineedtotholol
MC,You’re not violating my…
707,Itolduimahacker.
707,Butnoevidenceididit
JUMIN,What? It’s really a girl?
707,Ya.
707,Nope~
707,How dare you try to violate someone’s privacy like that.
JUMIN,?
ZEN,Is that MC!?
YOOSUNG,omg I thought we were respecting her privacy?
JAEHEE,;;;;;
JAEHEE,That is a photo of me.
YOOSUNG,Oh right! Sorry I was too excited;;
ZEN,So..sorry for not recognizing you;;
JAEHEE,"Mr. Han, you can’t recognize me either?"
JUMIN,…
JUMIN,Now what are we going to do?
707,V’s coming here soon. He just hung up.
V,I’m already logged in.
707,"Oh, V! You’re here ^_^"
ZEN,Finally he’s here.
V,Yeah. I guess I’m the last one to know about this.
JUMIN,Oh well.
V,"How is everyone? Jaehee, you’ve been well?"
JAEHEE,"Yes. It’s been a long time, V."
YOOSUNG,Hey V
V,Hey.
V,"Well, I heard about a situation."
V,MC is currently in Rika’s apartment with info from a stranger and logged into this chatroom.
707,I told him everything through the phone.
JUMIN,Who disclosed the password for Rika’s apartment?
V,Well. No one knew the password. I don’t even know.
YOOSUNG,…Thought V knew.
YOOSUNG,She never invited me to her apartment.
JUMIN,It’s the same for everyone else.
JUMIN,No one’s been there before.
YOOSUNG,Tell us the address. I’ll go there… I want to check who MC is myself.
YOOSUNG,"Seven, you know right? You traced the IP just now."
707,Uhm. Sorry but…
707,I can’t tell you that.
YOOSUNG,??
YOOSUNG,I’m her surviving family.
ZEN,Maybe because you’re just her cousin?
707,Not even her immediate family can go.
707,And the apartment doesn’t belong to Rika.
YOOSUNG,Then who?
V,Me.
YOOSUNG,You don’t even know the password!
V,I just respected her privacy.
YOOSUNG,…Were you really in a relationship with her?
JUMIN,I can’t believe you never knew the password.
V,I’ve never even been there. I just know where it is.
V,"Anyways, the apartment is in my name."
V,Rika usually worked there. There are a lot of documents in there that must not be damaged.
V,"I can’t reveal the address because all the classified information about this organization is stored there, plus other sensitive materials."
JUMIN,I didn’t know the place contained sensitive material.
YOOSUNG,"You don’t trust us enough to let us go, right?"
JUMIN,Don’t take it personally. It’s better to be ignorant sometimes.
V,"Yes, for the reason that Jumin said."
V,"Anyways, I can’t tell you the address. I’m sorry."
YOOSUNG,Then how did Seven know that the address he traced is Rika’s apartment?
JAEHEE,Since he’s responsible for the organization’s classified information.
707,"Yup. That’s true, but also I’m the one who developed this app."
707,Rika wanted to take care of some work through this too.
707,I went to her place to link the app with some of the documents in her computer.
YOOSUNG,Oh…
JUMIN,I see.
V,Only Luciel and I know the address.
V,"I repeat, since the information must be protected, please do not attempt to find the apartment."
V,"Do not ask Sen about it and Sen, please do not reveal the address."
MC,Luciel?
ZEN,That’s 707’s real name. ‘Luciel Choi’
JAEHEE,lol
YOOSUNG,omg Jaehee just said lol
JUMIN,I think it’s his baptismal name?
707,I’m going to go pray for a moment.
707,Happy 707 emoji*
MC,What’s classified information?
V,All the information there is classified.
V,So MC… Is that what I call you?
V,Please do not touch anything there.
V,"For example, if you try to force open one of the drawers…"
V,The alarm will ring.
ZEN,surprised-zen*
YOOSUNG,What do we do about her apartment?
YOOSUNG,Can MC stay there?
V,First…
V,"No one here is going to go to Rika’s apartment, right?"
V,"Since the information involves everyone around us, there might be trouble if we are not careful."
JUMIN,Yeah yeah. You can stop explaining. Classified information. Got it.
JUMIN,But it is a mystery how a complete stranger could end up there.
V,If it’s someone who knows the password…
V,It might be someone that Rika trusted.
JUMIN,Someone Rika trusted?
707,Confused 707 emoji*
ZEN,Confused Zen emoji*
V,I am only guessing…
707,So then that ‘Unknown’ person…
707,knew Rika!?
707,I can’t believe she trusted someone more than V.
YOOSUNG,I don’t believe that. She couldn’t have trusted anyone more than us…
ZEN,That is… a bit surprising.
V,It’s hard to believe myself… But we shouldn’t assume that we knew everything about Rika.
V,She…
V,had a deep world of her own.
YOOSUNG,…
JUMIN,"…Anyways, V, continue."
V,If I am right.
V,MC being at her apartment right now…
V,Rika must have wanted that.
JUMIN,Rika called in a complete stranger from up in the sky?
V,I’m not saying she wanted Sen to be there… but maybe…
V,Rika wanted someone to do the work she did before.
V,At the place she worked before.
JUMIN,What…?
ZEN,No way…
JAEHEE,The work Rika did before…
707,Hosting parties?
ZEN,You mean Rika’s party.
YOOSUNG,Do you really think… that Rika planned this?
YOOSUNG,If she made that decision when she was alive…
V,That’s my guess… but yes.
V,Since she didn’t leave a will.
V,"According to the information Luciel provided, MC doesn’t seem dangerous."
JUMIN,I’m not sure about this to be honest…
V,"Besides, she’s basically in the same boat now that she knows about this messenger app."
V,Whoever she might be.
707,But still…
ZEN,If that’s what V thinks…
MC,Who the hell is Rika?
ZEN,Can we tell her?
MC,I just came here to find the owner of the phone… What is going on…
707,Owner of the phone?
707,You were phished lol
707,"According to V’s guess, Rika… the person who used to live there"
707,had the person ‘Unknown’ convince u to go to the apartment.
JAEHEE,Wait…
JAEHEE,I understand… that everyone values V’s opinion.
JAEHEE,But…
JAEHEE,This chatroom is strictly prohibited to strangers.
JAEHEE,"If I may say so, I think that we must verify what MC has said."
JAEHEE,"For all we know, MC could have simply made up that ‘Unknown’ person."
707,I feel like Jaehee’s glasses are glinting right now.
JAEHEE,?
V,"Thank you for your opinion, Jaehee."
V,"But right now, I would appreciate it if you could trust me."
V,"If MC is not to be trusted, we can deal with it then."
JUMIN,Hmm.
MC,Please explain.
ZEN,Okay.
MC,I’m not really interested.
ZEN,How chic…
ZEN,Cute is nice but chic women have their own charms.
JUMIN,He’s gone insane.
707,Lol excited because she’s a girl?
ZEN,Yup.
JUMIN,Excited because of a stranger?
JUMIN,Your heart is insane.
707,Lololololol lmfao at what Jumin said.
707,Insane heart lolololol
JAEHEE,"Zen, isn’t it quite inappropriate to fall for someone you have never met?"
ZEN,Uhm. yes.
ZEN,I can’t control myself.
JAEHEE,omg
JUMIN,-_-
YOOSUNG,"MC, you may not be interested right now, but won’t you listen to what we have to say?"
YOOSUNG,You are involved now that you’re here.
YOOSUNG,Regardless of whether you like it or not.
707,"Ya. If you don’t cooperate, we can all team up to put u in trouble."
707,"First, we all know that u trespassed on the apartment^^"
ZEN,Surprised Zen emoji*
ZEN,Is that a threat?
707,Yup. I will threaten anyone in here who doesn’t follow V’s decision.
707,I am V’s slave.
V,…Uhm. Thank you?
YOOSUNG,Depressed Yoosung emoji*
YOOSUNG,Is that how we roll now?
707,Uhm. No lol
MC,Oh… Alright. I’ll listen for now.
707,Thank you for ur cooperation.
ZEN,Rika is…
ZEN,"V’s old girlfriend, and the person who created this chatroom."
YOOSUNG,Rika hosted parties regularly for a good cause.
YOOSUNG,She organized a group called RFA to plan the party and manage participants.
MC,A party?
707,Ya
707,She hosted a fundraiser to help those in need
707,and introduced the guests to one another to arrange business deals.
707,Rika
707,founded the organization called RFA four years ago and hosted two parties until so far.
707,The six of us who knew her personally joined the organization and helped her host the parties.
YOOSUNG,She was an amazing person…
YOOSUNG,She always sparkled.
ZEN,And Rika…
ZEN,is no longer here with us…
ZEN,She passed away a year and a half ago.
YOOSUNG,…
707,MC has to know this anyways…
ZEN,"Anyways, we still haven’t gotten over that yet"
ZEN,so please just keep it to yourself… MC.
JUMIN,I still can’t believe…
JUMIN,that Rika knew she’d pass away and planned all this.
JUMIN,But I’ll just consider it as true for now since V thinks so.
YOOSUNG,…I can’t imagine… someone else taking over what Rika did.
ZEN,"But if we continue on like this, there’s no need for the party or our organization to continue."
JUMIN,We don’t even know who she is though.
ZEN,Just the fact that she’s in this chatroom makes me trust her a bit though;;
JUMIN,Not because MC’s a girl?
V,Everyone… I know that this is confusing. But…
V,Maybe MC was chosen by Rika.
V,707 will look into that person called ‘Unknown’.
V,"So for now, please just believe in me and wait."
707,I guess ur busy right now. Ur replies are really late.
V,"Yeah, I think… I have to leave right now."
V,"MC, it is best not to touch anything in the apartment."
V,It won’t be good if the alarm rings.
V,Everything that you have to do… will be linked with this app installed on your phone.
MC,What do you mean?
MC,I thought this is just a messenger app?
V,I know there to be other features.
V,Seven will know the details.
707,Yeah.
707,This app program is not just a simple messenger.
707,All the party related emails in Rika’s computer
707,will be transferred to this app.
707,U’ll be able to automatically receive the guests’ information as well.
707,And send personal messages to other members…
V,Then there’s no need for MC to touch Rika’s old things.
JAEHEE,All MC has to do is use this app.
707,I put in all those features so that Rika could work more comfortably.
707,Glad there’s a use for them lol
ZEN,Hey. My messenger doesn’t have any email checking thing?
YOOSUNG,Mine neither…
YOOSUNG,Can’t my messenger tell me if my LoL friends are logged in?
707,omg
JAEHEE,Jaehee emoji*
V,I’m sorry…
V,But I have to leave.
707,"Okay. See u later, V."
V,Jumin.
JUMIN,?
V,Please take care of things for me.
JUMIN,…Alright.
707,…V’s gone.
ZEN,Yup. What’s he so busy with?
JUMIN,None of your business.
707,"Anyways, let’s do what V said. MC, u can log into this chatroom from time to time right?"
ZEN,Yup. And come chat with us regularly.
JUMIN,Why doesn’t everyone stop stalking and Assistant Kang summarize everything for her.
JUMIN,And invite her to the organization.
JAEHEE,Alright.
JAEHEE,RFA is an organization Rika created so that anyone can freely make donations regardless of class or nationality.
JAEHEE,"At the time, she hosted quite large parties once every two years, and they were very successful."
ZEN,Those were busy days. I thought people were going to trample me.
JAEHEE,This chatroom was used to discuss plans for the party.
707,I created this chatroom lol.
YOOSUNG,Everyone knows that already…
JAEHEE,Because this chatroom contained a lot of information that cannot be publicly released
JAEHEE,the app was distributed in secret only for RFA members.
JAEHEE,"But ever since Rika passed away, we have not hosted a single party"
JUMIN,Yeah… not a single one.
JUMIN,"We wanted to, but without Rika, we couldn’t proceed."
JAEHEE,…And this chatroom became a place for us to talk about personal matters.
707,We check that everyone’s alive with this chatroom and literally just chat.
YOOSUNG,We shared our memories of Rika too.
JAEHEE,"…MC, I think you were led to that place without any explanation."
JAEHEE,"If V is right, it seems that someone sent you there to fill Rika’s position."
JAEHEE,"Considering that you knowing about the existence of that place as satisfies the conditions for joining the organization, following V’s orders…"
JUMIN,"Fyi, currently there are six members. Me, V, Zen, 707, Yoosung, and Assistant Kang. Everyone in the chatroom."
ZEN,"If MC joins, it will be seven."
YOOSUNG,Is she… really becoming a new member?
JUMIN,We didn’t hear from MC yet. 
JUMIN,MC.
JUMIN,"All we are trying to do is host parties, raise funds, gather people… and things like that."
JUMIN,Our organization has done a lot of good so far.
JUMIN,… You will never regret joining.
YOOSUNG,I thought Jumin was against her. Why the sudden change?
JUMIN,I am only following V’s decision.
ZEN,"If you join the organization, we’ll be able to talk more. Not everyday we meet a pretty girl."
707,Uhm. How do you know she’s pretty? I didn’t even send the photo. 
ZEN,Send the photo.
707,No.
ZEN,Damn.
JUMIN,Men will be men.
ZEN,And you’re not a man?
707,Heard somewhere Jumin’s gay.
ZEN,Omg…
ZEN,Go away. You scare me.
JUMIN,Not even worth responding to that.
YOOSUNG,"But Zen, you have really low standards. You still care for looks?"
JAEHEE,Famous people must not act that way.
ZEN,Gosh~ I’m not famous~
JUMIN,Everyone stop messing around.
JUMIN,I was talking?
JAEHEE,I apologize.
JUMIN,"MC, will you join RFA?"
MC,What do I get if I join?
ZEN,Whatever your heart desires.
JUMIN,It would be nice if you could.
ZEN,"MC, are you interested in musicals?"
YOOSUNG,"Zen, I never knew you were so into girlsss!!"
ZEN,"No, I just like the real deal."
ZEN,"Join, MC."
ZEN,Winking heart Zen emoji*
ZEN,Do you want to talk privately? I’ll give you my number.
707,"Zen, why are u being so aggressive lol?"
ZEN,Haha…
JUMIN,Has it been 3 years since his last fling?
ZEN,It’s been longer. Damn…
ZEN,But I’ve never seen you with a woman? Ever?
YOOSUNG,Stop it… Guys…
YOOSUNG,I’ve never… been with anyone…
JAEHEE,…
ZEN,…
707,Crying 707 emoji*
JUMIN,Anyways.
ZEN,"Ye, yeah."
ZEN,"Anyways, we’re just going to think that you’re joining, Sen."
MC,Alright. It looks fun. I’ll give it a go.
YOOSUNG,That’s a fast decision..
JUMIN,Ha. I like it.
JAEHEE,I wonder if you have thought this through.
ZEN,"Welcome, MC. Oi, Seven. Register her info asap."
707,Ya. I have to register her before she changes her mind.
YOOSUNG,Even the processing is fast…
YOOSUNG,"MC must be a positive person, seeing that she made her decision so fast."
JAEHEE,She may not be a careful person.
JUMIN,"Assistant Kang, is there something you do not like about her?"
YOOSUNG,"Hey~ Jaehee, don’t be like that."
JAEHEE,It is not that.
YOOSUNG,…I’m glad we have a girl now! It was a hopeless sausage fest until now lol.
YOOSUNG,"MC! If you have any questions, I can answer them."
YOOSUNG,Ask anything you need.
YOOSUNG,No need to worry about anything ^^
707,Good. I’ve registered her as a member! Oh. We don’t really need ur signature.
YOOSUNG,"You’re going to collect all the info so she can’t run away, right?"
707,^^… Since it’s a verbal contract.
ZEN,…Don’t collect anything without MC’s permission.
707,Ya.
707,I’m gonna leave for a sec. Need to check sth.
ZEN,Background check on MC?
707,Nah~ It’s work. I have to make a living somehow.
YOOSUNG,Stop it. You get paid enough.
707,How do u know how much I get paid?
YOOSUNG,I saw your new car on fb…
707,Oh lol. Did u like the photo?
YOOSUNG,Yup.
707,Good job lol.
707,I’m gonna peace out.
JAEHEE,"Well, since she has joined, I think everyone can leave if they need to."
ZEN,Yeah?
JUMIN,Hmm. Let me check my schedule…
YOOSUNG,Okay.
707,"Anyways, welcome MC."
YOOSUNG,Welcome!! Good luck to us.
ZEN,"Glad you joined, MC ^^"
JUMIN,We’ll see how you do.
JAEHEE,"For now, I look forward to working with you."
ZEN,Oh… By the way
ZEN,I had a good dream last night. I think I saw you there…
ZEN,Or not. Bye~!
YOOSUNG,"I really want to know what kind of person you are, MC."
MC,Just one lonely sheep longing for someone’s arms.
YOOSUNG,I… I’m not quite a wolf…
YOOSUNG,"But if you want.. I can turn into a wo, wolf…"
YOOSUNG,or maybe not T_T
MC,What’s a wolf? ^^
YOOSUNG,Oh ^^;;
YOOSUNG,Uhm… It’s… ^^;
YOOSUNG,Sorry..
YOOSUNG,Just forget about it.
YOOSUNG,I feel like I went out of line..
YOOSUNG,You seem really innocent…
YOOSUNG,Blushing Yoosung emoji*
YOOSUNG,I’d like to meet you in person ^^
MC,I’m gonna eat you up RAWR
YOOSUNG,!?!?
YOOSUNG,>//< Ah.. Well!
YOOSUNG,It’s late now!!!
YOOSUNG,Blushing Yoosung emoji*
MC,I’m a pretty unique person.
YOOSUNG,"Wow, you must have some sort of talent."
YOOSUNG,I’m so jealous of people who are good of something.
YOOSUNG,Seven has an immense personality too.
YOOSUNG,Well… immense is the wrong word. It’s more like unmanageable ^^;
YOOSUNG,But I think you two will get along pretty well!
YOOSUNG,Seven is really busy all the time though T_T
YOOSUNG,He’ll talk for hours and then disappear for a day or two.
MC,I’m just an average person.
YOOSUNG,"Wow, thanks for answering!"
YOOSUNG,I’m pretty normal too ^^
YOOSUNG,I’m not as rich as Jumin…
YOOSUNG,"Next to Zen’s good looks, no one will look at me…"
YOOSUNG,I don’t have a cool career like Jaehee.
YOOSUNG,And it’s not as if I have some extraordinary talent like Seven.
YOOSUNG,But I try my best to stay confident. ^^
MC,It’s nice to see that you’re positive.
YOOSUNG,Thank you. ^^
YOOSUNG,I try my best to stay positive.
YOOSUNG,Don’t hesitate to come to me when you feel gloomy~!
YOOSUNG,Happy Yoosung emoji*
MC,So what.
YOOSUNG,What?
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,Uhm…
YOOSUNG,Crying Yoosung emoji*
YOOSUNG,"You’re not intentionally being mean, are you?"
YOOSUNG,I hope I didn’t offend you or anything…
YOOSUNG,I’m not sure what I did but I’m sorry.
YOOSUNG,Could you please be nicer to me?
MC,Haha I’m joking.
YOOSUNG,Haha.
YOOSUNG,I’m sure you’re having fun teasing me.
MC,Nope lol
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,I want to chat with you often.
YOOSUNG,"I didn’t get to see the photo, but Seven said you’re cute and I believe him..!"
MC,Lol you’re gonna be so surprised when you see me in person.
YOOSUNG,Why? Because you’re really pretty!? Because you’re actually a movie star!?
MC,I hope so;
YOOSUNG,"To be honest, I don’t really care for gorgeous and fancy people."
YOOSUNG,Zen’s a pretty famous musical theater actor.
YOOSUNG,He got so many girl fans because of his looks
YOOSUNG,and now he’s a huge narcissist…
YOOSUNG,Crying Yoosung emoji*
YOOSUNG,"Whenever he looks into the mirror, he smooths out his hair like twenty times. In a strange pose;;"
YOOSUNG,Kind of douchey haha
MC,Ya.
YOOSUNG,Omg so rad! haha
YOOSUNG,But you know.
YOOSUNG,I don’t really care about looks…
YOOSUNG,Pretty strange…
YOOSUNG,I just like anyone who can play games with me ^^
MC,I’m not really the cute type…
YOOSUNG,"Still, I like you!"
YOOSUNG,I think anyone with a good personality looks nice.
YOOSUNG,^^
YOOSUNG,…I say this but honestly I’ve never even dated a girl at my school!!!
MC,Thank you ^^
YOOSUNG,You talk cute too haha
YOOSUNG,You must really be a cutie.
YOOSUNG,I am quite the cutie myself!
YOOSUNG,I made a hat with a towel at the spa to wear
YOOSUNG,and all my friends tackled me telling me how cute I am.
YOOSUNG,I can never wear the towel hat because of that..T_T
YOOSUNG,"If only I could visit Rika’s apartment, I’d be able to meet you..."
YOOSUNG,…But V told us not to go and I can’t disrespect him. T_T
YOOSUNG,So please chat with me often ^^
YOOSUNG,I’ll be off now to play games!
MC,What games?
YOOSUNG,I play a game that is popular these days which is called LOLOL.
YOOSUNG,Have you heard of it?
MC,LOLOL? League of Loneliness of Life?
YOOSUNG,Wow! I can’t believe you know League of Loneliness of Life!
YOOSUNG,Not a lot of girls know that game… Ur awesome!
YOOSUNG,I play in the Shooting Star server ^^
YOOSUNG,"If you want to play with me, I usually play from 10PM to 4AM, so keep that in mind ^^"
MC,LOLOL? Ludicrous Otaku and Lego Otaku’s Life?
YOOSUNG,…What?
YOOSUNG,Ludicrous Otaku? Lego Otaku?
YOOSUNG,What’s that?
YOOSUNG,Confused Yoosung emoji*
YOOSUNG,Oh… Maybe you like Lego..? ^^;
YOOSUNG,I have some I used to play with as a kid. I’ll give them to you if I get the chance.
MC,Have fun~
YOOSUNG,I’ll be off now. ^^
YOOSUNG,Don’t stay up too late and sleep tight~!
MC,I still have no idea how to play this game T_T
JAEHEE,Game?
JAEHEE,What are you talking about?
JAEHEE,Rika’s work is not a ‘game’.
JAEHEE,A ‘game’ is what Yoosung obsesses over every night and gives him dark circles.
MC,Sorry if I hurt your feelings^^;
JAEHEE,you do not have to care about my feelings.
JAEHEE,I am only Mr. Han’s assistant.
JAEHEE,You cannot really consider me an official member as I am not personally acquainted with V.
JAEHEE,"Anyways, please do not refer it as a game."
JAEHEE,It is a charity organization that Rika and V worked very hard to establish.
MC,I just said it because it looked fun.
JAEHEE,Fun…?
JAEHEE,Is work fun to you?
JAEHEE,You are quite peculiar.
JAEHEE,"You may feel a sense of accomplishment, but I’m not sure about fun."
JAEHEE,I cannot understand you.
MC,"Jaehee, why are you awake?"
JAEHEE,Hello.
JAEHEE,I’ve been documenting what occurred today.
JAEHEE,I guess… you could call it a journal.
MC,Aren’t you tired?
JAEHEE,I usually get three to four hours of sleep every day.
JAEHEE,I usually stay awake at nights.
MC,Shouldn’t you be getting more sleep…?
JAEHEE,Are you worrying for me?
JAEHEE,How gracious of you.
JAEHEE,But please take care of yourself first?
JAEHEE,It is not easy taking over Rika’s work.
JAEHEE,"If anything is difficult, I will help you."
MC,I’m jealous that you don’t need a lot of sleep~!
JAEHEE,;;;
JAEHEE,It’s nothing to get jealous about.
JAEHEE,You are jealous of unnecessary things…
MC,You’re so diligent.
JAEHEE,Being diligent is necessary to be an assistant.
JAEHEE,"Are you not a diligent person, MC?"
MC,I am quite the diligent one.
JAEHEE,I did not know you are diligent.
JAEHEE,That is good but…
JAEHEE,I would like to ask if you are really aware of the current situation…
JAEHEE,A normal person would have been very surprised at what happened today.
JAEHEE,"To be honest, I do not fully trust you."
JAEHEE,I advise you to be careful of what you say and do.
MC,Thank you for your advice.
JAEHEE,Oh… I apologize.
JAEHEE,I went over the line.
JAEHEE,Thank you for being so understanding.
MC,Why are you being so fussy;;
JAEHEE,Because I am an assistant.
JAEHEE,Please do not complain and I hope you hone your skills and take care of Rika’s work.
JAEHEE,You can ask me for help anytime.
MC,I’m pretty lazy;
JAEHEE,I see.
JAEHEE,I admire your honesty.
JAEHEE,However.
JAEHEE,Being lazy becomes a habit.
JAEHEE,…I hope I don’t sound like I’m lecturing you.
MC,You do;;
JAEHEE,I apologize if I’ve offended you.
MC,It’s nothing. You’re just concerned for me.
JAEHEE,Thank you for thinking so.
JAEHEE,All the members in the organization are good people…
JAEHEE,But they tend to ignore what I say thinking I am only nitpicking.
JAEHEE,It’s probably because I do not talk in a charming way.
JAEHEE,Maybe you would be better than I am in that area.
JAEHEE,"If you are confused about Rika’s work, then I will explain."
JAEHEE,Emails will be sent to the computer in Rika’s apartment.
JAEHEE,The arrived emails will automatically be sent to your phone.
JAEHEE,They will mostly be rsvp emails for the party or questions.
JAEHEE,You must be selective and convincing so that the party goes well without any problems.
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,It is quite late.
JAEHEE,I must go to bed now.
JAEHEE,You must be quite exhausted as well. Have a good night’s rest…
JAEHEE,Good bye.
MC,"Hello, Zen."
ZEN,What’s a pretty lady staying up this late?
ZEN,Can’t fall asleep?
ZEN,Me neither.
ZEN,"To be honest, my heart’s been beating so fast ever since you joined our group."
MC,My heart’s beating fine.
ZEN,How could it be after seeing my looks…?
ZEN,Look at my profile photo.
ZEN,Look again.
ZEN,Look at it more.
ZEN,Your heart’s still not pounding?
MC,A bit?
ZEN,"Yeah, that’s how it all starts."
ZEN,I don’t seem that attractive… just a bit over average??
ZEN,And then…
ZEN,As if… you’ve been pulled into a black hole
ZEN,you’re sucked into my infinite charm.
ZEN,You don’t have to take it all in at once.
MC,Nope;
ZEN,…Are you
ZEN,a guy?
ZEN,Surprised Zen emoji*
ZEN,Did Seven get the wrong information?;;
ZEN,Anyways… I get that my charm doesn’t work on you.
ZEN,Crying Zen emoji*
ZEN,I’m sorry I flirted a bit.
MC,*drool*
ZEN,What;?
ZEN,…
ZEN,Does that mean you like me?
ZEN,I’m your type?
ZEN,I guess I’ll think of it that way for now lol
ZEN,Well… I do have a lot of fans who fell for my looks.
MC,^^;;
ZEN,What is that polite you’re-making-me-uncomfortable emoji?
ZEN,Alright. I’ll stop haha
ZEN,"You’re new, and I was just curious."
ZEN,Men can get playful no matter how old they are.
ZEN,Oh! But that doesn’t mean I’m old! Not at all!
MC,My heart’s beating fast too.
ZEN,lol
ZEN,So cute.
ZEN,"Can’t tell if your heart is really beating fast, or if you’re just typing that."
ZEN,I’ll have to see everything to know.
MC,Whuuut… Perv…
ZEN,Perv? What’s going on inside your head?
ZEN,Hahahahaha
MC,No thanks.
ZEN,lolol
ZEN,Aren’t I charming?
MC,Screw you
ZEN,That’s a pretty old school response.
ZEN,"Lol, you’re quite funny."
MC,Ya;;
ZEN,Are you blushing? lol
ZEN,Don’t. I’ll stop myself now.
ZEN,I was half joking lol
MC,I have quite an elaborate imagination.
ZEN,Oh god.
ZEN,Now I’m blushing;;
MC,"In this dark endless night, art the water drops on the window my solitude, or thy teardrops."
ZEN,Whut;;?
ZEN,Are you Shakespeare or something?
ZEN,Art thou from the Victorian age?
ZEN,Or do they teach sonnets at school these days?
MC,I’m Emily Bronte.
ZEN,"Oh, is Emily Bronte Shakespeare’s daughter?"
ZEN,Maybe not?
ZEN,Confused Zen emoji*
ZEN,"Again, didn’t do very well in school."
ZEN,Well anyways…
ZEN,I get that you’re being poetic.
ZEN,I don’t know what it really means though.
ZEN,"But according to you, I’m crying and you’re lonely?"
ZEN,Do you… want to see me… cry?
ZEN,Lol… Then you should have said so.
ZEN,I guess I do look pretty good… when I shed tears.
ZEN,I don’t really get it but a lot of girls say that. lol
ZEN,Hahaha
ZEN,Anyways… I’ll stop playing around.
MC,It’s not a sonnet.
ZEN,"Huh? Oh, I thought that anything with ‘art’ are called sonnets."
ZEN,Sorry. Didn’t do very well at school.
ZEN,Well anyways…
ZEN,I get that you’re being poetic.
ZEN,I don’t know what it really means though.
ZEN,"But according to you, I’m crying and you’re lonely?"
ZEN,Do you… want to see me… cry?
ZEN,Lol… Then you should have said so.
ZEN,I guess I do look pretty good… when I shed tears.
ZEN,I don’t really get it but a lot of girls say that. lol
ZEN,Hahaha
ZEN,Anyways… I’ll stop playing around.
ZEN,I finally feel relieved now that you’ve joined the organization.
ZEN,"To be honest, I don’t like any of the guys in the group."
ZEN,The Chairman-in-line is born with a silver spoon in his mouth and likes to brag about his money.
ZEN,"Seven’s a funny guy but,"
ZEN,sometimes he’s such a… weirdo;;
ZEN,Yoosung’s cute but he doesn’t really take me seriously.
ZEN,I stayed in the group because of V…^^
ZEN,I think it’ll be fun if we get to be friends.
ZEN,…It’s been five years since I’ve had a girlfriend. Damn.
MC,Why that long?
ZEN,I wasted a couple of years trying to get in the industry..
ZEN,and now I’m too busy to meet people.
ZEN,Chatting and joking around like this is pretty much all I do these days.
MC,You can go out with me.
ZEN,Wow…
ZEN,You’re a genius.
ZEN,Winking heart Zen emoji*
ZEN,Hahahaha
ZEN,Well~~
MC,It’s been longer for me.
ZEN,Crying Zen emoji*
ZEN,T_T
ZEN,You’re more advanced than I am.
ZEN,Sorry I didn’t recognize that.
ZEN,But it’s probably not because you’re not attractive.
ZEN,I have the looks of a Greek God… but trying to earn a living and make a name for myself…
ZEN,Getting a girlfriend has become a dream.
ZEN,Let’s cheer up!
MC,You must be unattractive.
ZEN,Unattractive? lol
ZEN,I guess everyone has different tastes.
ZEN,I don’t think that I didn’t have a girlfriend because I’m unattractive.
ZEN,I was busy trying to survive in this world.
ZEN,"Anyways, I get that I’m not your type."
ZEN,I think I’ll get a girlfriend when it’s time.
ZEN,It’s fun talking to you.
ZEN,I hope we can talk often lol
ZEN,Happy Zen emoji*
ZEN,Then I’ll go and rest now.
ZEN,"Don’t stay up too late, pretty girl."
ZEN,Winking heart Zen emoji*
YOOSUNG,Do you know that Zen always complains about being single these days?
YOOSUNG,But I’ve never even been in a relationship T_T
MC,Are you not interested in girls?
YOOSUNG,I think I am interested.
YOOSUNG,…I guess…
YOOSUNG,I feel better when I team up with a girl character when playing games.
YOOSUNG,And it makes it more interesting if there’s a girl in the guild…
YOOSUNG,"But of course, the competition always gets intense and I never get a chance… T_T"
YOOSUNG,I don’t think I’m not interested though.
YOOSUNG,"When Seven said that you’re a girl, my heart did… jump?! a little."
YOOSUNG,Heehee…
MC,You’ve never had a girlfriend;;;?
YOOSUNG,No…
YOOSUNG,All I did in school was study…
YOOSUNG,…and play in a band and become school president…
YOOSUNG,I’ve been asked out on dates before!!!
YOOSUNG,But I didn’t say ‘yes’ because I wanted to focus on study… And…
YOOSUNG,…
YOOSUNG,I can’t say any more T_T
MC,Cheer up^^;
YOOSUNG,I don’t know how to cheer up…
YOOSUNG,But I guess all you have to do is rely on your instincts(?)!?
YOOSUNG,I’m twenty one now and that means I’m an adult!
MC,I’ll tell you how to get it on.
YOOSUNG,!?
YOOSUNG,What?
YOOSUNG,Uh… Does that mean;;
YOOSUNG,.Oh…
YOOSUNG,I’m blushing… T_T
YOOSUNG,Don’t tease me too much.
YOOSUNG,Blushing Yoosung emoji*
MC,Hahahaha Tsk tsk
YOOSUNG,Omg…
YOOSUNG,Are you laughing at me?
YOOSUNG,…
YOOSUNG,I guess I deserve that T_T
YOOSUNG,But I feel weirdly comfortable getting laughed at…
YOOSUNG,Haha…
MC,Me too…
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,I knew you were innocent…!
YOOSUNG,"To be honest, no one’s as innocent as I am in the group."
YOOSUNG,I’m probably the only one who’s never been in a relationship before.
YOOSUNG,Crying Yoosung emoji*
YOOSUNG,Well… I don’t know about Seven though…
YOOSUNG,Anyways!!
YOOSUNG,I’m not lonely because I have you!
YOOSUNG,;; It’s a bit sad saying this buy
YOOSUNG,let us single people cheer up!
YOOSUNG,…Let’s get fried chicken together some time.
YOOSUNG,T_T
MC,Fried chicken makes you fat… ^^;
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,I… I see. I guess it’s wrong to ask a girl to eat fried chicken with me T_T
YOOSUNG,Sorry…
MC,Sounds kewl.
YOOSUNG,Kewl!!!
YOOSUNG,I really like you T_T
YOOSUNG,I have class at 9 so I have to go take the bus now.
YOOSUNG,The poor fate of a college student…!
YOOSUNG,Oh right! Do you want to see what I made for breakfast?
MC,Enjoy your breakfast ^^
YOOSUNG,You have to eat breakfast too!
YOOSUNG,Breakfast is your energy source for the day.
YOOSUNG,I’d love to cook for you once we’re not banned from the apartment.
MC,I wanna marry ya.
YOOSUNG,Whut
YOOSUNG,Blushing Yoosung emoji*
MC,Gimme food too.
YOOSUNG,I’ll cook for you next time ^^
YOOSUNG,I have to go now. I’m almost running late!
YOOSUNG,"MC, let’s talk soon! >_<"
MC,You haven’t left for work yet?
ZEN,Good seeing you~!
ZEN,I don’t have a set work time.
ZEN,Why hasn’t the Director dude left for work yet?
JUMIN,I was just about to go out.
JUMIN,"Welcome, MC."
MC,Hello.
ZEN,Welcome MC~
JUMIN,Hello.
ZEN,So lame that you responded to her with another hello lol
JUMIN,I have to be polite to a member of the RFA.
ZEN,Aha. I see you’re helpless in front of V.
JUMIN,Isn’t everyone in this organization?
MC,"But Jumin, don’t you have to go to work?"
JUMIN,I was about to.
ZEN,No one’s going to give the executive a hard time for being late.
JUMIN,Assistant Kang will say something though.
ZEN,"Oh, right."
MC,"What were you doing, Zen?"
ZEN,I was about to get breakfast.
ZEN,I’m an actor so my schedule’s flexible.
ZEN,I’ll go to rehearsal in the afternoon lol.
ZEN,"But Mr. Corporate Executive, you’re not going to work?"
JUMIN,I was just about to leave…
MC,I’m sleepy…
ZEN,You’re quite the sleeping beauty.
ZEN,Happy Zen emoji*
JUMIN,There is a way to wake up early.
JUMIN,You just have to plan something that excites you in the morning
JUMIN,"For example, drinking tea while watching the morning news…"
ZEN,Hmm… You mean like Micdonald’s breakfast combo?
JUMIN,"What are you doing at this hour, MC?"
MC,"Now that the sun has risen, my body and mind ache in loneliness."
ZEN,If your body and mind feel lonely whenever the sun rises… you must be lonely every day.
ZEN,Except when it rains.
JUMIN,The sun rises on rainy days too.
JUMIN,I’ve kept my loneliness in check since a long time ago.
JUMIN,Excess emotion is a needless luxury.
ZEN,Such a robot. Whd
JUMIN,I’ll take that as a compliment.
JUMIN,Emotions only interfere with business.
ZEN,You’re the creepy one who sucks up to everyone to make them sign contracts.
ZEN,That’s what Jaehee said before.
JUMIN,What’s wrong with that?
MC,I’m lonely… I’m painfully lonely.
ZEN,I… always get really lonely in the fall and winter.
ZEN,You know that moment right after you wake up and feel like you’re the only one in the world?
ZEN,"As it gets closer to winter, the day gets shorter…"
JUMIN,Haha.
JUMIN,"If you’re busy like me, you never have time to feel lonely."
ZEN,Emotionless freak;;
MC,Jumin’s kinda scary ;;
ZEN,Right? He’s a creep.
JUMIN,It’s not so bad to be feared.
ZEN,"MC, let’s ignore him and just talk among ourselves."
ZEN,Nothing good will come out by talking to him.
JUMIN,Hmm… that’s too black and white.
MC,I was just bored lol
JUMIN,I see. I guess you come here for the same reason as Zen.
ZEN,What are you talking about. It’s the same for you too.
JUMIN,I won’t deny that.
JUMIN,This chat room is quite addictive.
JUMIN,I can brag about Elizabeth 3rd as much as I want.
ZEN,Whatever;;
ZEN,No one cares about cat pictures.
ZEN,Depressed Zen emoji*
JUMIN,Take this.
ZEN,Depressed Zen emoji*
MC,Wow! So pretty.
JUMIN,Thank god at least one person appreciates her beauty.
MC,Oh. A cat.
JUMIN,Hmm.
MC,omfg…
ZEN,MC’s surprised! God.
ZEN,Are you okay?
JUMIN,A cat is not a bomb.
JUMIN,A cat is a cat.
JUMIN,I tend to believe that a person who likes animals cannot be bad…
ZEN,You only believe what you want to believe.
JUMIN,"Certainly, is that not life?"
ZEN,Don’t pretend to be so above everything!
JUMIN,Anyways.
JUMIN,"Cats are the best pet, so MC, you should look into it."
JUMIN,Elizabeth 3rd is the only one who sees me off to work.
JUMIN,She’s the only one I need.
ZEN,What are you talking about;; You make all of your maids see you off.
JUMIN,What I mean is… Elizabeth 3rd is the only one who sees me off with a loving soul.
ZEN,Loving soul lol
ZEN,"If you treated your employees with a loving soul, they’d polish your shoes and lay out a red carpet."
JUMIN,It’s a waste giving yourself to people you’ve employed. It’s a business relationship. Money should be all there is to it.
ZEN,Well. That depends on the person.
ZEN,"What do you think, MC?"
MC,It’s better to treat people like actual human beings than to be so strict.
JUMIN,I forget what you call that.
JUMIN,A family-like company? Ha.
ZEN,"MC, ignore that pompous jerk."
ZEN,The director that I work with is really nice to the actors.
ZEN,He buys us food with his own money and stays late to encourage us.
ZEN,So I enjoy every show.
ZEN,One director I worked with before just did his job and took his paycheck…
ZEN,And the result was just that too.
JUMIN,That’s a good example.
JUMIN,"It’s not my style, but I should acknowledge that society is diverse."
MC,Isn’t it natural to just work as much as you get paid.
JUMIN,That is correct.
ZEN,There are a lot of people who don’t work as much as they get paid.
ZEN,"If their bosses give them the look, they have to work more than what was agreed…"
JUMIN,My company doesn’t have anything like that.
ZEN,I think that whatever you do… human emotions are always involved.
JUMIN,A true pro never involves emotions with work.
ZEN,Can anything valuable come out without any emotion?
JUMIN,You can think that way since you’re an actor.
JUMIN,"Anyways, I agree with MC."
ZEN,"I’ve seen people online crying out that working in your company is like being a slave, but I may be wrong."
JUMIN,They should be honored to be my slaves. They are probably tears of joy.
MC,I’m pretty sure it’s tears of joy +_+
JUMIN,Right?
JUMIN,It’s probably more so for people working close to me.
JUMIN,Since I directly… give directions and control them.
ZEN,Zen emoji*
ZEN,That must be hell.
JUMIN,Yes.
ZEN,Didn’t expect MC to agree with that jerk;;
JUMIN,That is appropriate.
ZEN,I’m not in a good mood right now.
MC,Can we change the subject?
ZEN,I want pizza bread.
JUMIN,I don’t know why pizza bread exists.
JUMIN,Why do we need pizza bread when we have pizza?
JUMIN,All the franchise bakeries seem to sell it.
JUMIN,Hmm. Is it because people don’t have enough money to eat pizza?
JUMIN,"It tastes like pizza, but it’s cheaper."
JUMIN,I guess it familiarizes commoners with the taste of pizza.
ZEN,;; I can’t watch you insult pizza bread any longer.
ZEN,Then do people buy coffee bread because they want coffee but it’s too expensive?
JUMIN,Your rebuttal is very strange and unappealing.
MC,Well… Labor management relations is always a complicated issue.
ZEN,Yeah. Let’s talk about something else.
JUMIN,We can talk about cats.
ZEN,No.
JUMIN,"MC, do you like cats?"
MC,Cats are a bit scary.
ZEN,I’m scared of them too!
ZEN,Their eyes glint at night.
JUMIN,It’s a misunderstanding.
ZEN,"Still, scary is scary."
ZEN,"We’re pretty similar, MC…"
ZEN,I kind of like you.
ZEN,Winking heart Zen emoji*
JUMIN,"Ha, I’ll respect your taste."
JUMIN,But I will faithfully pursue only cats.
MC,I tend to like them.
JUMIN,I knew V has a good eye for people.
ZEN,You’re an animal loving girl.
JUMIN,"Fluffly fur, cute and pink paws…"
JUMIN,The perfect pet that is even affectionate.
ZEN,"If I have to get a pet, I’d get a dog."
ZEN,A cat’s a bit too;;; sensitive. Not for me.
MC,I prefer dogs.
ZEN,Right?
ZEN,I’m allergic to fur so I can’t have pets anyways.
ZEN,But that ‘unquestionable’ loyalty that dogs have… is so innocent and heartbreaking.
ZEN,Humans will never be like that.
JUMIN,Ha.
ZEN,It’s a quality that you don’t have at all.
JUMIN,I’m human so I don’t need that quality.
JUMIN,Cats are enough.
ZEN,Zen emoji*
ZEN,"Yeah yeah, go marry a cat."
ZEN,I won’t have to give congratulatory money then.
JUMIN,So you were actually thinking of paying.
ZEN,Surprised Zen emoji*
MC,I prefer cats.
JUMIN,A woman who recognizes the beauty of cats. I’ll have to reconsider you.
JUMIN,Do you know that even Assistant Kang doesn’t care for cats?
JUMIN,My heart aches that this beautiful creature is not appreciated enough.
ZEN,Hmm….
ZEN,"Well, maybe MC’s sensual like cats."
ZEN,"I don’t like cats, but I do love cat-like women lol"
JUMIN,I cannot believe you’ve turned our wonderful discussion of cats vulgar.
JUMIN,"I hope we talk more about cats when Zen’s not here, MC."
JUMIN,I don’t care what other people think.
JUMIN,Elizabeth 3rd’s love is all I need.
ZEN,I bet you sleep while hugging the cat.
ZEN,I can’t even begin to imagine all the fur on your bed.
JUMIN,…Did you just imagine my bed?
ZEN,Get lost.
ZEN,Angry Zen emoji*
JUMIN,"Ha. If you live with one, you’ll see that they are the best animals. Oh, I guess you’ll never get to because of your allergy. How tragic. You are missing out on a big joy of life."
ZEN,Don’t care. I have plenty of other joys.
ZEN,I’m going to leave now to enjoy one of those which is reading fan letters and practicing my lines.
ZEN,Bye.
MC,"Good bye, lovely Zen ^^"
ZEN,…Lovely Zen?
ZEN,omg. my heart just jumped a bit.
MC,Good bye.
ZEN,Have a good day MC.
JUMIN,I’m leaving first.
JUMIN,Adios…
ZEN,What’s with that old man…;;
ZEN,Let’s talk again soon ^^
ZEN,Happy Zen emoji*
MC,"Hello, Jumin."
JUMIN,Welcome.
707,"Huh? Welcome, MC!"
MC,"Hello, 707."
707,Wow! Isn’t it the infamous MC! Welcome~!
JUMIN,Our lady of the evening.
JUMIN,My driver isn’t here yet.
JUMIN,Thanks to that I can’t go to work.
707,lol take the subway.
JUMIN,I don’t know where that is. And I don’t have cash.
707,Knew it lol.
707,"Oh. MC, u know that Jumin has a cat, right?"
707,I want to see her~
JUMIN,"Anyways, I’m worried that there are a lot of people who don’t understand the beauty of cats in this world.."
JUMIN,I should have the company carry out more cat related businesses.
707,lmfao
707,Jumin’s a cat mom.
JUMIN,I do not like that term.
MC,Lol cat mom
JUMIN,Please do not call me that.
707,Then how about cat man?
707,Sparkly Seven emoji*
JUMIN,Call me by my name.
707,Trust fund baby cat? Director cat since you’re a Director?… Or~ Father… father or cat mom!
707,…That was a bit too much.
JUMIN,Call me by my name.
MC,The cat’s pretty.. haha
JUMIN,Of course.
707,I know right? She’s a pretty chill cat.
JUMIN,She is not cool. She is very picky.
707,Ya? She’s not picky with me.
707,Confused 707 emoji*
JUMIN,That’s because you forced Elizabeth 3rd to…
JUMIN,Jumin emoji*
JUMIN,God…
JUMIN,I don’t even want to talk about it.
707,Lol I can imagine him giving her cat food in his suit.
JUMIN,I heard organic food is good.
JUMIN,"Oh, I forgot."
JUMIN,"707, this is a chance for you to use your corrupt money to do good."
JUMIN,Donate some cat food.
707,Should I? Then will you let me play with Elizabeth 3rd?
JUMIN,I will never give her to you even if someone points a gun at my face.
707,Can’t I go over to your place?
707,Sparkly Seven emoji*
707,"You have a huge TV in the living room, and a Gray Station and Zet Box too. And also, Elizabeth 3rd lol"
JUMIN,The Gray Station and Zet Box are not there for you.
JUMIN,Don’t come over. Never come over.
JUMIN,I have footage of you biting Elizabeth 3rd’s neck on security tapes.
JUMIN,"If you come near my place, security will stop you."
707,"Alright, so all I have to do is hang around with this security guard and then go in lol. Okie dokie."
JUMIN,-_-
JUMIN,"MC, 707’s a dangerous man. Because…"
JUMIN,He never listens.
MC,Ya. I’ll have to careful.
707,Nah~ I love everyone.
707,You don’t have to be careful of me haha
JUMIN,"Well, I guess you don’t have to be."
JUMIN,Whether you are careful or not 707 has the ability to get his way.
707,Ya?
707,Happy 707 emoji*
MC,"Seven, what do you do?"
JUMIN,Didn’t someone tell you he’s a hacker?
JUMIN,But no one knows which organization 707 works for.
JUMIN,He might have other jobs other than hacking.
707,Hmm… Aside from hacking…
707,I fry bacon at the office. I burn music CDs too.
JUMIN,It’s his trait to give you generous amounts of useless information.
707,Why! Bacon is a huge source of protein!
MC,Seven just seems like he likes to joke around?
707,Yup! That’s right.
707,Wow! Ur like the only one who gets me in this group.
JUMIN,The jokes of a dangerous man and the jokes of a not-so-dangerous man are different.
707,I am not dangerous~!
707,Ur cat is alive and well haha
JUMIN,Barely. She is alive for now.
707,I want to play with Elizabeth again haha
707,Loving 707 emoji*
707,Maybe I should get a cat?
JUMIN,…
707,"Anyways, thanks for getting me, MC!"
707,I am also very devoted to my religion.
707,My heart is full of love and peace!
707,Why can’t anyone recognize the love inside of me?
JUMIN,"If that’s love, then you’re a sadist."
707,What’s that?
707,Sparkly Seven emoji*
JUMIN,Don’t ask. You know already.
JUMIN,Also
JUMIN,don’t ever come near Elizabeth 3rd again.
JUMIN,You’re dangerous.
JUMIN,"You’ve been to Rika’s apartment, and you kept quiet all this time."
707,"Well, I had no choice because it was top secret."
707,Crying 707 emoji*
JUMIN,How many secrets do you have? You give me goosebumps;
707,I’m in charge of managing top secret information lol.
MC,I think he’s funny.
707,Wow! She thinks I’m funny.
707,"I’d like to gift u the thrill and joy of riding a roller coaster, MC!"
707,Cheering 707 emoji*
JUMIN,I will absolutely refuse.
JUMIN,A roller coaster ride from a person with secrets is only a fantasy.
MC,Have you been here?
707,"Ya. But it was just once, and I don’t even remember where it is now~"
707,I just went to install AP…
707,I was only working hard for the organization T_T
JUMIN,I don’t believe that you don’t remember the location.
JUMIN, With that gigantic brain of yours.
707,Is my brain that big?
707,Sparkly Seven emoji*
707,I dunno about any secrets~
707,lol
JUMIN,…
707,lolololololol
707,"lol well, I guess… I do have secrets."
707,Since I take care of classified information~!
JUMIN,"It’s funny to you too, right?"
707,"Ya, a bit."
707,I am a bit of the secretive type.
JUMIN,People with secrets are always dangerous.
707,"Don’t be like that, Jumin~"
707,Don’t fear me.
707,"If u come over to my place, I’ll give u a smothering hug."
JUMIN,Whatever; ; I’m really going to work bow.
JUMIN,I just stuck around because my driver’s running late.
707,Cheer up! Whoot whoot!
JUMIN,"Luciel, you have a good day too."
MC,"Bye, my bae character~"
JUMIN,…
JUMIN,I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that.
MC,Good bye.
JUMIN,"Hope everything goes well, MC."
JUMIN,Alright then.
707,I’ll give u the proper cat mom send off.
707,Good bye for meow~★
707,Happy 707 emoji*
707,No one knows how affectionate I can be lol
707,Right?
707,I hope u believe me.
MC,I’ll believe you.
707,Okay…
707,Thank you.
707,"Ur a nice person, MC!"
MC,I’ll see.
707,lol
707,Okay. Hope u make the right decision~
707,I can’t change how u think.
707,I’ll peace out now.
707,I have to work T_T
707,The company’s lucky to have me as their slave…
MC,Laterz
707,Laterz
MC,Good bye.
707,I’ll be waiting until the day we get to talk again.
707,^^
707,Let’s see if I can research more on MC.
YOOSUNG,Did you find something? I want to know too.
707,Ok. I will make an exception and let you in on some info.
YOOSUNG,+_+
707,"She’s a girl. Young. In my standard, she is cute."
YOOSUNG,Confused Yoosung emoji*
YOOSUNG,I don’t know what your standard is like but go on.
707,Two beautiful eyes and pink lips.
707,She must be reading this conversation through her smartphone.
707,"That’s enough, right?"
YOOSUNG,Are you sure you can sure that much information?
YOOSUNG,"is what you thought I would say, right? -_-"
YOOSUNG,Just admit that you don’t know much about her.
707,"Ok, I don’t."
YOOSUNG,Sighing Yoosung emoji*
YOOSUNG,"Well, but now it sounds like you’re lying."
707,Hmm…
707,Hmmmm~.
707,I’m actually not doing a background check on her… I’m searching for the person who sent MC to Rika’s apartment.
YOOSUNG,"Oh, I see!"
YOOSUNG,"If you find out, will you tell everyone!"
707,That depends on V.
707,As always~
YOOSUNG,He makes it clear that he knows everything but never gives anything out.
707,Maybe.
707,I can’t help it tho T_T
707,Why would the information be called ‘classified’?
YOOSUNG,…
707,I have to leave now. Just got more work~
YOOSUNG,"You have to take care of it right away, right?"
YOOSUNG,I finished my lunch so I have to go too.
707,Ok.
YOOSUNG,Okay~
MC,"Jaehee, please tell me about Rika."
JAEHEE,Yes? Oh..
JAEHEE,Your sudden question surprised me.
JAEHEE,But I guess your curiosity is natural.
JAEHEE,This all happened so suddenly.
JAEHEE,Rika managed a charity business.
JAEHEE,"Before she passed away, she and V planned a life together."
JAEHEE,Rika’s charity involved many things but…
JAEHEE,the most central project was hosting parties in her and V’s name.
MC,"Hello, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,"Hello, MC."
JAEHEE,I was just thinking about you.
MC,Are you doing a background check on me?
JAEHEE,That is not my job.
JAEHEE,But if it were to be someone’s job…
JAEHEE,it would be 707’s.
JAEHEE,I understand that you are anxious.
JAEHEE,You suddenly got involved with strangers in this chatroom.
JAEHEE,But…
JAEHEE,Do not worry.
JAEHEE,No one in the RFA will harm you.
JAEHEE,What I cannot stop thinking about is…
JAEHEE,that only you were allowed to stay in Rika’s apartment.
JAEHEE,It is quite an irony.
JAEHEE,"We who’ve worked with Rika cannot enter the place,"
JAEHEE,and yet you who are a complete stranger can stay there…
MC,About me?
JAEHEE,Yes. Since you are at Rika’s apartment.
JAEHEE,"And other than you, no one can go near that place."
JAEHEE,It is quite an irony.
JAEHEE,"We who’ve worked with Rika cannot enter the place,"
JAEHEE,and yet you who are a complete stranger can stay there…
JAEHEE,The apartment that you are in probably has all the documents relevant to what Rika did.
JAEHEE,If you fill Rika’s position.
JAEHEE,then maybe we will be able to host the parties again.
JAEHEE,What do you think?
MC,I’ll think about it.
JAEHEE,I agree that it’s something to be carefully considered.
JAEHEE,Please take all the time you need to consider it.
JAEHEE,But… if you decide to leave…
JAEHEE,then Luciel and V will take time to decide whether or not to let you go peacefully.
JAEHEE,Since you already know too much about the organization.
MC,I think it will be fun.
JAEHEE,Fun…?
JAEHEE,"I don’t know. It’s ultimately about dealing with people, so I guess it can be fun."
JAEHEE,Depending on your personality.
MC,Can’t someone else do it?
JAEHEE,It would be nice if that were possible…
JAEHEE,"But as you know, you are the only one who can enter Rika’s apartment."
MC,So… what will I have to do? Specifically…
JAEHEE,Happy Jaehee emoji*
JAEHEE,That is a good question
JAEHEE,I will explain.
MC,Jaehee. Are you always so formal?
JAEHEE,I guess I may seem that way to you .
JAEHEE,Unlike the other members…
JAEHEE,I did not become a member through my acquaintance with Rika or V.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han forced me to join.
JAEHEE,"So to me, the work regarding the organization…"
JAEHEE,is nothing more than a part of working for the company.
JAEHEE,First… since you will have to handle the work
JAEHEE,I will give you a brief explanation about what you will be doing.
MC,Okay.
JAEHEE,Rika exchanged various emails with party guests at the apartment.
JAEHEE,"As far as I know, she approved or declined guests depending on the theme of the party."
JAEHEE,"Even if the person had no desire to attend the party, she convinced them so that they make an appearance."
JAEHEE,That is… what you will be responsible of.
JAEHEE,"If you take care of the task well,"
JAEHEE,then it will be possible to host the party again.
MC,What’s the benefit of hosting the party again?
JAEHEE,There are a lot of benefits.
JAEHEE,First…
MC,Is the party that grand?
JAEHEE,"In terms of size, it is quite magnificent."
JAEHEE,But it is not only that…
JAEHEE,I think it will be meaningful that Rika’s mission isn’t hindered and continues on.
JAEHEE,"Especially, I presume that V, who has not really been involved with the organization after Rika’s death, will change."
JAEHEE,"Currently, V is not really active in the organization."
JAEHEE,He rarely logs into the chat room.
JAEHEE,So… everyone is probably hoping for V to come back.
JAEHEE,Except for Yoosung.
MC,Do you hope V to come back?
JAEHEE,I…
JAEHEE,Well I don’t know.
JAEHEE,That’s a difficult question.
JAEHEE,Ah…
MC,Why except for Yoosung…?
JAEHEE,That’s…
JAEHEE,That is something you should hear from Yoosung or V.
MC,It’s too difficult T_T
JAEHEE,Was my explanation too boring?
JAEHEE,There should be at least one member who gives the boring explanations.
JAEHEE,But you must remember what I have told you.
JAEHEE,"I would like to talk with you further, but I must leave for a moment."
MC,Good bye.
JAEHEE,I will see you again.
JAEHEE,I hope… Rika’s work goes well.
MC,"Bye, ma’am."
JAEHEE,What?
JAEHEE,Confused Jaehee emoji*
JAEHEE,…Are you assuming that I’m much older than you?
JAEHEE,I will be off.
MC,"Hello, Jumin."
JUMIN,"Hello, MC."
MC,Whassup mista trustfundkid
JUMIN,Ha
JUMIN,Are you being playful?
MC,"How do you do, Mr. Han?"
JUMIN,You talk like Assistant Kang.
JUMIN,I do not really like being called that.
JUMIN,Congratulations again on joining the organization.
JUMIN,"It’s easy to enter, but leaving won’t be so easy."
MC,Is that a threat?
JUMIN,A little bit.
JUMIN,You’re pretty quick.
MC,Why?
JUMIN,The reason’s simple.
JUMIN,You’re at Rika’s apartment.
JUMIN,Rika’s private documents are probably there as well.
JUMIN,That’s strictly classified.
JUMIN,You only have to deal with the information we need.
JUMIN,The information regarding the party.
JUMIN,You’ll have access to all the information about the party that Rika managed.
JUMIN,I hope that you’ll take on the task and continue her work without any trouble.
MC,Don’t worry. I’ll do a good job.
JUMIN,You’re a smart girl.
JUMIN,Happy Jumin emoji*
MC,Is the job hard?
JUMIN,The level of difficulty will change depending on what kind of person you are.
JUMIN,Rika was a very persuasive person.
JUMIN,"If you are too, the job won’t be too difficult."
MC,"It’s too hard. Help me, lovely Jumin."
JUMIN,Are you the same type as 707?
JUMIN,Although I have never been called lovely before
JUMIN,I don’t really want to hear that in the future.
JUMIN,All the party guests had to contact Rika.
JUMIN,It was her job to convince them to participate.
JUMIN,It won’t be easy. I hope you do a good job.
MC,I’ll try my best.
JUMIN,I like that confidence.
JUMIN,If you do a good job…
JUMIN,We’ll get to host parties again.
JUMIN,Don’t you want to make memories you’ll never forget?
MC,I’d like to do something meaningful.
JUMIN,It’s a big event that helps those in need.
JUMIN,You will definitely feel proud of the accomplishment.
MC,"I’d like to do it with you, Jumin."
JUMIN,With me?
JUMIN,Hmm.
JUMIN,I don’t quite understand you.
JUMIN,"Anyways, I won’t take it as a bad thing."
MC,I’m not interested.
JUMIN,Then what is your interest?
MC,Cats
JUMIN,What…?
JUMIN,Your interest is cats.
JUMIN,You know the true beauty of this world.
JUMIN,"The soft fur, cute and pink paws, the adorable meows."
JUMIN,They are mystic and admirable creatures.
JUMIN,Ahem.
JUMIN,Anyways.
MC,Conquering the world.
JUMIN,Uhm….
JUMIN,I’ll get Assistant Kang to refer you to a psychiatrist.
JUMIN,I think you and 707 will get along very well.
JUMIN,…Will you be able to do Rika’s work?
MC,Making a living with my kind of man.
JUMIN,Ha.
JUMIN,You have the cinderella dream.
JUMIN,Many women believe that Cinderella’s hardships will be made up for by future stability and wealth.
JUMIN,Whether it’s their type of man or a movie star
JUMIN,temporary tricks to obtain what they do not deserve… are disgusting.
JUMIN,There are many women like that around me.
MC,So all I have to do is be good at picking randomly?
JUMIN,Picking… randomly?
JUMIN,Doesn’t that refer to… what you do when you don’t know the answer to a question and choose based on probability?
JUMIN,Probability of being right and probability of being wrong…
JUMIN,God…
JUMIN,quiet-jumin… Jumin emoji*
JUMIN,How useless.
JUMIN,I’m worried whether you’d be able to do Rika’s work.
JUMIN,"If anything happens, ask me or Assistant Kang."
JUMIN,I’m busy so I can’t log in here often.
JUMIN,"Assistant Kang may seem picky, but she’s hardworking and true to her words."
JUMIN,She’s trustworthy.
JUMIN,"Anyways, I have to go to work now."
MC,Good bye.
JUMIN,Okay.
JUMIN,Go to bed early.
JUMIN,Tomorrow morning might be the best time to work.
MC,See ya~
JUMIN,See ya~
JUMIN,…Is that what you thought I’d say?
JUMIN,Assistant Kang will nag me if I talk like this.
JUMIN,Then I’ll be off.
JUMIN,Good luck.
MC,Today’s weather was nice.
ZEN,Today?
ZEN,Not really…
MC,"Zen, Hi~"
ZEN,"Hey, MC."
ZEN,I just finished my rehearsal and came home.
ZEN,I just took a shower. Finally I can breathe.
ZEN,I didn’t like today’s weather.
ZEN,It rains here…
ZEN,If your weather is different from where I am.
ZEN,then we must be pretty far apart.
ZEN,We rehearsed in the basement today and it was so humid I thought I was going to die.
ZEN,Headache…
ZEN,Depressed Zen emoji*
MC,Are you okay?
ZEN,Yeah. I feel better after taking a shower.
ZEN,I wish we could rehearse where there’s good ventilation.
ZEN,But I guess that’s too good to be true.
ZEN,Thanks for worrying.
MC,Did you have fun at your rehearsal?
ZEN,Yes!
ZEN,Happy Zen emoji*
ZEN,"I don’t have a piece I’m working on, so I just focused on my vocals today."
ZEN,I wish you could hear me sing.
MC,I’d like to hear it too.
ZEN,It’s another joy singing for someone else.
ZEN,I guess I’ll have to practice extra hard.
MC,I’m tone deaf.
ZEN,Hahaha
ZEN,So cute.
ZEN,"No worries. If we ever go to karaoke, you can leave the mic with me."
ZEN,Winking star Zen emoji*
MC,I bet I can sing better.
ZEN,Oh I see. So you’re pretty talented?
ZEN,Let me listen when you get the chance.
ZEN,"I have to practice in the basement right now, but I hope I get to work on a new project soon and practice in proper rehearsal rooms."
ZEN,The director says that he’d get a new project soon but…
ZEN,"To be honest, without the parties, my sponsors in the musical industry have left one by  one."
ZEN,It’s already been a year and a half.
ZEN,Since our last party.
ZEN,Rika’s party was packed with sponsors…
ZEN,There were a lot of people from the art industry.
MC,I feel a bit of pressure.
ZEN,Haha.
ZEN,I understand.
ZEN,"Everyone talks about Rika to you, so you must be pretty tired of that."
ZEN,Don’t be so stressed.
ZEN,Just do what you can do.
ZEN,^^
ZEN,The parties were still amazing though.
MC,The party was that big?
ZEN,"Yes, it was…"
ZEN,"To be honest, it was all thanks to Rika."
ZEN,She was so good at dealing with people and talking.
ZEN,I thought she was using some sort of magic.
ZEN,I didn’t really see that when we first met.
ZEN,It’s probably because of Rika’s amazing convincing skills and V’s fame that the parties were so influential.
ZEN,Since everyone wanted to buy V’s work.
MC,Fame?
ZEN,Oh. I guess you don’t know about V.
ZEN,V is a famous photographer.
ZEN,"…He’s famous within the industry, but not to the public."
ZEN,He doesn’t like being in the press or being talked about.
MC,Work?
ZEN,Yeah. V’s a photographer and he’s really famous within the industry.
ZEN,"He refuses interviews and stays hidden, so he’s not popular."
ZEN,But V’s photos… draw people in.
ZEN,"He doesn’t usually sell his photographs, but at the parties he made an exception, so more people came."
ZEN,But…
ZEN,I don’t think I should go into detail about V…
ZEN,He doesn’t like other people talking about him.
ZEN,He is quite secretive…
ZEN,but he’s really a good person.
ZEN,I respect him a lot.
ZEN,Happy Zen emoji*
ZEN,"I’m going to grab some food now, MC."
ZEN,Did you eat?
MC,I’m hungry…
ZEN,T_T
ZEN,"Make sure you don’t skip meals, okay?"
ZEN,You get depressed and negative when you’re hungry.
MC,I already ate.
ZEN,Good.
ZEN,It’s important to eat well. ^^
ZEN,Then I’ll get going.
ZEN,Let’s talk again.
ZEN,"Oh, and also…"
ZEN,This is a photo I took while I was a practice.
ZEN,Then see you later ^^
ZEN,Winking heart Zen emoji*
MC,Whoah~! Who’s this guy?!
707,Drumroll plz! It’s SEVEN-ZERO-SEVEN!
707,Clap everyone~!
MC,"Hello, 707."
707,Huh? Hey MC~
707,Glad you came lol
MC,Whoot! Whoot~!
707,Hey babe~
MC,I’m here babe.
707,omg.
707,That was a bit disgusting just now.
707,Ur hard to beat…MC…ugh.
707,Even I can’t handle it.
707,Can’t believe someone beat me…T_T
707,lololol
MC,-_-
707,lolololol
707,Sorry.
707,To be honest.
707,I came to procrastinate  because I couldn’t focus on work.
707,Why can’t I focus?
707,Confused 707 emoji*
MC,Because you like me?
707,Because I like u?
707,…Is it that?
707,Hmm… If u and my Star Wars lego spaceship both drown
707,then I will shout to u to get on that spaceship and escape.
707,…Is this…
707,what people call
707,LO
707,VE?!
707,Shocked 707 emoji*
MC,Because you don’t have a cat.
707,Maybe that’s why?
707,I guess I need Elizabeth 3rd.
707,Maybe I should kidnap her ^^
707,Watching Jumin’s angry face is gonna be
707,SO
707,MUCH
707,FUN lolol
707,Cheering 707 emoji*
MC,Lack of caffeine.
707,I don’t drink coffee.
707,"I don’t drink coffee, alcohol, or smoke. The only thing I drink is PhD. Pepper."
707,I’m a nice guy who doesn’t do anything bad!
707,I only ethically hack.
707,Happy 707 emoji*
MC,Because I joined the organization?
707,Hmm…
707,…Yes.
707,"To be honest, I found something cute about u."
707,The password for ur online shopping mall account and ur email account
707,are
707,the
707,same!
707,It’s so cute….lololol
MC,Omg… How did you hack it?
707,Hmm. How did I?
707,I don’t know lol
707,I told you. I was only pretending to hack ur accounts.
707,I’m only researching about that ‘Unknown’ person.
MC,They’re different?
707,What? They r?
707,Hmm…
707,Joke failed!
707,I told you. I was only pretending to hack ur accounts.
707,I’m only researching about that ‘Unknown’ person.
707,"Okay, joke’s over."
707,"To be honest, what I was thinking was…"
707,What if Rika was alive?
707,I can’t get that thought out of my head.
MC,Do you have feelings for Rika?
707,Yes I do.
707,If only I could give up my life to get her to come back…
707,It would be nice if only I could do that.
707,She did more good to the world than I would ever do.
707,"If it weren’t for Rika, I wouldn’t be here right now."
707,^^
MC,Maybe she is really still alive?
707,Hmm..
707,I really wish so ^^
707,She was such a good person.
707,There needs to be more people like her… in this world.
MC,Any possibility that ‘Unknown’ is ‘Rika’?
707,That would be nice…
707,but I don’t think so.
707,V has repeatedly told us that she doesn’t exist in this world any longer… and I’ve yet to see Rika’s trace in the digital world since he said that.
707,But…
707,I’m sure it’s someone that has to do sth with Rika.
707,So…
707,I really want to find that person.
707,Thinking about this makes me sad.
MC,My looks are better.
707,Of course lolol
707,That’s actually a photo of me lol
707,My boss said that everyone would be more productive if I cross-dress
707,so I made this enormous sacrifice for everyone lolol
MC,She’s beautiful.
707,This is…
707,a photo of me lolololololol
MC,Why did you have to show it now;;
707,>_<
707,I don’t like talking about depressing and serious things.
707,I hope there’s only happiness.
707,R u smiling at my photo?
707,I hope u r ^^
MC,Cross dressing!?
707,Ya
707,"My company said that it would be fun, so I did it."
707,lololololol
707,"If I can make everyone happy, then why not…"
707,It was pretty fun lolol
707,"Anyways,"
707,I’m continuing the research on the person who took you to Rika’s apartment.
707,V did order me to.
707,But what I’m worried about…
707,is the possibility that u r in danger.
707,"If that ‘Unknown’ person is not somehow related to Rika, then it means a third party"
707,knows information about the RFA and ur location.
707,If anything happens…
707,please come to this chatroom.
MC,Okay.
707,^^
707,Even though I can’t be the knight in shining armor to protect u
707,I want to be able to tell the knight who the villain is.
MC,I can protect myself.
707,I like that attitude lolol
707,Just be safe.
707,Don’t suddenly disappear or anything like that. ^^
707,I think I have to peace out now.
707,It’s getting dark.
MC,Thank you for telling me all these things.
707,I’m the one to thank u for listening to me.
MC,"Good bye, 707."
707,"Yes, have a good evening."
707,Happy 707 emoji*
707,Then peace out.
MC,What are you doing at this hour?
YOOSUNG,"Oh, you’re here!"
YOOSUNG,I just came home from the library and was taking a break.
MC,"Hello, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,"MC, hey ^^"
YOOSUNG,Today’s the day you joined the organization.
YOOSUNG,"Usually at this hour, I would have been playing games…"
YOOSUNG,but I couldn’t really calm myself down.
YOOSUNG,Why don’t we talk more about ourselves?
MC,Are you good at games?
YOOSUNG,Haha yes!
YOOSUNG,I’m actually ranked in the top 100.
YOOSUNG,Not just any ranking but in the world ranking!
YOOSUNG,Oh.
YOOSUNG,I don’t really want to talk about myself…
YOOSUNG,I want to know more about you.
YOOSUNG,"Like what your interests are, what u do…"
YOOSUNG,Hmm…
YOOSUNG,But I’d rather get to know you gradually than ask you a bunch of questions.
YOOSUNG,^^
MC,What do you want to know?
YOOSUNG,"Well, all Seven told us is that"
YOOSUNG,you’re a cute girl.
YOOSUNG,"I want to know… your interests, what you do, and things like that in detail."
YOOSUNG,I do want to ask you directly.
YOOSUNG,But it does feel a bit too soon for that…
YOOSUNG,I would just like to talk to you like this and get to know you gradually.
YOOSUNG,I think all the organization members are thinking the same thing.
YOOSUNG,If you could do what Rika used to do
YOOSUNG,we’d get to host parties again!
MC,What do I have to do?
YOOSUNG,I don’t think it’s anything difficult.
YOOSUNG,It’s probably just… responding to emails that are sent to Rika’s apartment.
YOOSUNG,You won’t have direct access to Rika’s computer…
YOOSUNG,They will probably be sent to your phone separately.
YOOSUNG,I’ve never done it before…
YOOSUNG,But I think it’s important and difficult.
YOOSUNG,It’s dealing with people.
YOOSUNG,Rika did all that while smiling all the time… She was amazing.
YOOSUNG,She always managed to host the party successfully.
YOOSUNG,She must have worked so hard to do that.
YOOSUNG,So…
YOOSUNG,The result of the party will change depending on how u handle the work.
MC,I’ll do my best ^^
YOOSUNG,You’re really a good person…!
YOOSUNG,Yes! Thank you ^^
MC,You just do whatever I say.
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,Okay.
YOOSUNG,I feel like I have to surrender to you lol
MC,I feel quite a bit of pressure.
YOOSUNG,I’m sorry if I pressured you.
YOOSUNG,To give… a bit more information about the party…
MC,Party?
YOOSUNG,Yes!
YOOSUNG,The greatest thing that Rika did when she was alive… was definitely hosting parties.
YOOSUNG,That was why our organization existed.
YOOSUNG,I was a high school student then so I couldn’t help much…
YOOSUNG,but I’d like to help a lot this time!
YOOSUNG,To give… a bit more information about the party…
YOOSUNG,"Rika invited people from all sorts of backgrounds, like prestigious organizations, wealthy corporations, and outcasted but talented people."
YOOSUNG,"V, who’s a photographer, sold his photographs and donated all the profit."
YOOSUNG,It was incredible… and so fulfilling…
YOOSUNG,Everyone enjoyed it. Even V…
YOOSUNG,I think everyone remembers it well.
YOOSUNG,"So when u joined the organization, everyone probably thought the same thing."
YOOSUNG,If everyone could work like when Rika was alive…!
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,Do you feel pressured because of everything I’m saying?
YOOSUNG,"If V donates his photographs, then I’m sure a lot of people will come."
YOOSUNG,So you don’t have to worry so much.
MC,I hope I can be of help.
YOOSUNG,You should know that you helped us just by appearing.
YOOSUNG,"Now I feel like Rika didn’t disappear completely,"
MC,Don’t look forward to it too much.
YOOSUNG,I knew I pressured you too much T_T
YOOSUNG,I’m sorry if all this talk about the party made you feel uncomfortable.
YOOSUNG,"If anything happens, I’ll help you so cheer up."
YOOSUNG,^^
YOOSUNG,Even though I’m a university student…
YOOSUNG,I don’t really go out of my way to get the perfect GPA.
YOOSUNG,"I try participating in all kinds of clubs, and play games when I come home."
YOOSUNG,I think about how I can enjoy every moment in life.
YOOSUNG,It’s such a tragedy to not feel happy during happy times.
YOOSUNG,So I hope that you don’t feel too burdened and stressed because of everyone’s hopes.
YOOSUNG,Everyone hopes to host the party again…
YOOSUNG,"but if you are unhappy during the process, then I don’t think it means anything."
YOOSUNG,So… don’t go out of your way too much.
YOOSUNG,Okay?
MC,Thank you.
YOOSUNG,Sure!
YOOSUNG,Tell me whenever it gets hard!
MC,I’ll do what I can.
YOOSUNG,Okay. Don’t feel so burdened.
YOOSUNG,I should go play games now!
YOOSUNG,There’s a pretty important showdown today.
YOOSUNG,Wish me luck so I can win!
MC,Good luck!
YOOSUNG,Thank u >_<
MC,Don’t get too into playing games.
YOOSUNG,Omg… you’re totally nagging me right now.
YOOSUNG,Alright. T_T
YOOSUNG,Then see ya~!
MC,"Hello, Jumin."
JUMIN,"You’re here, MC."
JUMIN,Was your day productive?
ZEN,"Hello, MC."
MC,"Zen, you’re on."
ZEN,"Hey, MC."
ZEN,"The day’s coming to an end, and I’m getting lonely."
JUMIN,"Weak minds surrendering to solitude, how sad."
ZEN,I don’t want to hear that from someone who got a cat because he’s lonely.
JUMIN,You are mistaken if you think Elizabeth 3rd is a pet that merely soothes my loneliness.
JUMIN,She is my companion. We have a life together.
ZEN,Whatever. I don’t want to talk about cats… I feel like sneezing.
ZEN,Why do I feel so sentimental today?
ZEN,Not like usual.
JUMIN,Do you even know what sentimental means?
ZEN,Isn’t it… being excited and anxious at the same time like teenage?
JUMIN,Well. It means you become sensitive.
JUMIN,I know the reason behind that.
ZEN,Why?
JUMIN,It’s because of MC.
ZEN,Yup. That’s true.
JUMIN,"Usually, Zen is busy annoying me."
ZEN,What…
ZEN,MC will think that I bother people all the time.
ZEN,Still. It’s true my attention’s somewhere else lol
ZEN,Because of MC.
MC,Why?
ZEN,I think everyone’s thinking the same thing~.
JUMIN,Hosting the party.
ZEN,Bingo.
ZEN,I keep asking myself if we can finally hosting parties again now that MC’s here.
JUMIN,It may be MC’s chance to prove her worth.
MC,Why do I have to prove my worth to anyone?
ZEN,Nice MC lolol
ZEN,Don’t succumb to that robot~
JUMIN,I have a habit of saying that to Assistant Kang. I’m sorry for saying that to a lady I’ve only just met.
JUMIN,To give my excuse…
JUMIN,I tend to believe that all humans think about their worth at the back of their minds.
JUMIN,But it’s true that you’re not obligated to prove that to others.
JUMIN,But I’d like to say one thing.
MC,"What is your worth, Jumin?"
JUMIN,"My worth is that I am not a person who goes out to the streets and screams, but a person who mitigates and negotiates in the back."
ZEN,"Wow you sound so important, Jumin."
JUMIN,People like ‘Zen’ can do all the screaming.
JUMIN,There are things only I can do.
ZEN,Hmph.
ZEN,Isn’t it because you don’t have the courage to go out on the streets and scream?
JUMIN,Think whatever you wish.
JUMIN,Anyways.
MC,Is it good that I’m here with you guys?
JUMIN,Time will tell the net profit.
ZEN,That was harsh;; MC is not your employee.
JUMIN,That’s not what I meant.
JUMIN,"If MC can’t handle Rika’s work very well, then she’s good for nothing. Just like Zen."
ZEN,What? That jerk.
ZEN,"MC, don’t listen to that pompous ass."
ZEN,He’s a stuck up jerk who judges everyone with his petty standards.
ZEN,"If you want to do Rika’s work then you do, if you don’t you don’t."
JUMIN,"To be honest, if she doesn’t do Rika’s work, then there’s no reason for her to be in this chat room."
JUMIN,Then V will tell 707 to deny her access to this room.
ZEN,Well…;; That’s kind of true.
MC,I first intend to try my best.
ZEN,MC… seems like a nice positive person.
ZEN,"Okay, I will help you as best as I can."
JUMIN,Everyone has to help.
JUMIN,If we decide to host the party.
MC,Do I have no choice?
JUMIN,It’s not that you don’t have a choice.
JUMIN,"You either leave and return to your life, or you stay and work."
JUMIN,You can choose.
ZEN,..I don’t want to say farewell to MC.
JUMIN,That depends on her choice.
JUMIN,And ‘farewell’? How long have you known her?
JUMIN,Pathetic.
ZEN,Shut up. It’s my choice.
JUMIN,The reason why the parties were all successful is because Rika managed the guests so well.
JUMIN,I wonder if MC will do well…?
MC,"If I try my best, then everything will be good."
JUMIN,Hmm.
JUMIN,I like the answer.
JUMIN,Softies like Zen or Yoosung will tell you not to feel burdened…
JUMIN,But I want you to do this job with a sense of responsibility and awareness.
JUMIN,No one will be unhappy if the results are good.
ZEN,I think you’re giving her a hard time.
JUMIN,"Well, I wouldn’t say this if I didn’t have expectations."
ZEN,"Hmph. You can just ignore him if you feel pressured, MC."
MC,I’m not sure yet… I’ll just do it for now I guess.
ZEN,It’s okay if you’re not good at it.
ZEN,"If you strain yourself trying to do well, then you’ll only feel more burden."
JUMIN,Well.
JUMIN,"Now that she’s a member, I would like her to finish Rika’s work perfectly."
ZEN,Rika chose you MC. You’ll do well.
JUMIN,What do you know about Rika?
ZEN,Well… yeah you’re right.
ZEN,I didn’t know Rika that well to be honest.
ZEN,I wasn’t really interested in her. Well… I was thankful for sure.
ZEN,But…
ZEN,Rika and MC are completely different people.
ZEN,You can’t expect her to do that same thing that Rika did.
JUMIN,I’ll say that’s true for now.
ZEN,Huh…
JUMIN,?
ZEN,The director wants to get dinner with me;
ZEN,I ate already T_T
ZEN,I guess I have no choice but to go since he basically controls me…
JUMIN,lol
JUMIN,I should go and provide Elizabeth 3rd her meal.
MC,"Tell your cat hello, Jumin."
JUMIN,Hmm. I’m not making any promises but I’ll try.
ZEN,You don’t need to say hello to cats;;
MC,"Go ahead, Zen."
ZEN,Okay.
ZEN,"Make sure you don’t skip your meals, MC."
ZEN,I’ll be off.
JUMIN,Good bye for meow.
ZEN,Don’t pretend to be a cat -_-
MC,"Zen, you’re not sleeping yet?"
ZEN,You’re awake too.
MC,Hello.
ZEN,Hi.
ZEN,I thought you’d be in bed.
ZEN,Too early for that?
ZEN,I don’t think I can sleep tonight.
ZEN,We have a new member and also…
ZEN,the shocking news that she’s at Rika’s apartment
ZEN,I think I’m going to be up all night thinking about you lol
ZEN,"Since the controversial one is here, let’s talk a bit."
ZEN,Do you usually go to bed late?
MC,I tend to.
ZEN,You’re a night owl?
ZEN,I go to bed pretty late too.
ZEN,"If I finish the practice late, I come home and practice my lines again."
ZEN,That keeps me up pretty late.
ZEN,It’s a bad habit but it’s hard to fix.
MC,No.
ZEN,Then you’ll probably go to bed soon.
ZEN,You must be pretty tired after everything that happened today.
ZEN,MC.
ZEN,How do you feel about getting involved in all this.
ZEN,If I were  you… I would have said no.
ZEN,It’s too much of a bother lol
MC,I am a bit curious to see what will happen.
ZEN,I like your honesty.
ZEN,"Right now, you’ll be confused…"
ZEN,"about what Rika used to do, what the party is and all that."
ZEN,Take your time to figure things out.
ZEN,Also think about if this is the right choice for you.
MC,I’m excited for all the things to come.
ZEN,Excited…
ZEN,"Yes, there will definitely be exciting moments."
ZEN,"Now that you’re a member, I hope that you experience happy things that you would never regret."
ZEN,"Regardless of what happens, you’re the girl who gets all the guys’ attention."
ZEN,Something good is bound to happen.
ZEN,It would be better…
ZEN,if that something happens with me haha
MC,That’s good haha
ZEN,hahahaha
ZEN,lmfao
ZEN,You’re so honest haha
MC,I’m a bit lost.
ZEN,I get that confusion…
ZEN,But think of it positively.
ZEN,This is a place where you get to meet people you’d never otherwise meet.
ZEN,"You have the trust fund kid, the assistant, the cute college boy… the kind of crazy dude."
ZEN,Why don’t you try enjoying this?
ZEN,"To be honest, I’d like to meet you in person."
ZEN,Of course… V will never let me.
MC,Is V that important?
ZEN,Yeah. He’s amazing.
ZEN,He’s important to everyone…
ZEN,but the organization can’t exist without him.
ZEN,Since RFA was founded by Rika and V.
ZEN,"At this point without Rika, if V quits the organization…"
ZEN,RFA will crumble.
MC,What do you want to do when you meet me?
ZEN,Hahaha
ZEN,Good question…
ZEN,It depends on what you want.
ZEN,"Since I’m an actor, I can act out anything."
ZEN,Why don’t you use that?
ZEN,Anyways…
ZEN,I can’t figure out what V is thinking.
ZEN,He’s probably with Seven trying to find out who led you to the apartment.
ZEN,Thinking about that makes my head hurt lol
ZEN,I am a member…
ZEN,"So I fully trust V, and intend to follow whatever he decides."
ZEN,I hope you get the chance to talk to V more.
ZEN,But unfortunately… he rarely logs in.
MC,Is V his name?
ZEN,No… It’s the name he uses for his photographs.
ZEN,His name is…
ZEN,You should her it from him when you get the chance.
ZEN,It’s a friendly Korea name.
MC,Why doesn’t V come here often?
ZEN,You can only log in to this chatroom when you have internet.
ZEN,"As far as I know, V travels a lot these days."
ZEN,So I think… it’s because he often goes to places where he does not have internet access.
ZEN,I don’t know why he travels that much though.
ZEN,I have to go practice my lines.
ZEN,You should to go bed early.
ZEN,We can talk tomorrow. ^^
MC,I’ll go to bed soon.
ZEN,Good girl.
ZEN,You’re cute.
MC,I’m going to rage all night.
ZEN,By raging I assume you mean…
ZEN,You’ll be chatting with Yoosung who stays up all night to play games.
ZEN,Then I’ll get going.
ZEN,Oh. I forgot.
ZEN,This is a photo that V gave me as a gift…
ZEN,He told me to think of it whenever I feel nervous.
ZEN,I think about this photo before I go up on stage.
ZEN,If you… feel nervous too…
ZEN,I hope this helps you get over it.
ZEN,Good night…!
MC,"Yoosung, what are you up to?"
YOOSUNG,Hey MC!!!
YOOSUNG,I can’t believe I’m talking to the new member~
YOOSUNG,I still feel dazed.
MC,Whachu doin?
YOOSUNG,You’re here!
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,I was… waiting for you!
YOOSUNG,I can’t even focus on gaming today.
YOOSUNG,I have so much on my mind because of you…
YOOSUNG,What do I do?
MC,Aren’t you expecting too much from me?
YOOSUNG,I never ever want to pressure you!
YOOSUNG,Of course I do have expectations. But!!
YOOSUNG,If it bothers you… I don’t want to pressure you at all!
MC,Why don’t you try exercising for a bit and then go to sleep?
YOOSUNG,Exercise…
YOOSUNG,Exercise…
YOOSUNG,Someday I will.
YOOSUNG,…
YOOSUNG,Should I get a gym membership too?
YOOSUNG,Zen has such a good body.
YOOSUNG,I’m jealous.
YOOSUNG,I feel like he’s from a different planet.
YOOSUNG,Got it from Zen’s fan blog lolol
MC,I don’t exercise either.
YOOSUNG,Comrade!!
YOOSUNG,But still it’s good for the body to exercise…
YOOSUNG,We should exercise together later! lolol
YOOSUNG,But you know lol
YOOSUNG,"Even if I do exercise, I probably won’t be able to sleep."
MC,Aww yeah~ Eye candy lol
YOOSUNG,lolol I know right?
YOOSUNG,Zen’s the perfect guy!!
YOOSUNG,But you know lol
YOOSUNG,"Even if I do exercise, I probably won’t be able to sleep."
MC,Not really interested;
YOOSUNG,Um. Thought girls usually like things like this.
YOOSUNG,Okay T_T I won’t send it to you anymore if you’re not interested.
YOOSUNG,But you know lol
YOOSUNG,"Even if I do exercise, I probably won’t be able to sleep."
MC,Are you love sick?
YOOSUNG,Omg…
YOOSUNG,Uhm… I’m sorry for saying this…
YOOSUNG,But you must think very highly of yourself.
YOOSUNG,My mind’s going blank now -_-…
YOOSUNG,…
YOOSUNG,I’m just kidding! lol
YOOSUNG,I can’t get thoughts of you out of my head…
YOOSUNG,Haha
YOOSUNG,The reason why I’m so excited is…
YOOSUNG,It might be because I’m a coward and I want to feel Rika through you.
YOOSUNG,I don’t know what I feel…
YOOSUNG,I feel so complicated.
MC,Did you like Rika?
YOOSUNG,Of course… She was my cousin.
YOOSUNG,We weren’t really close when I was young…
YOOSUNG,But I got to help her charity business by accident… and ended up going the organization.
YOOSUNG,She was such an amazing person.
YOOSUNG,I still can’t believe… that a person like that took her own life.
MC,I see.
YOOSUNG,Yeah… I wish you could have met her.
YOOSUNG,You would have become good friends. ^^
MC,All this talk about Rika is making me uncomfortable.
YOOSUNG,Oh… Sorry.
YOOSUNG,I’m sure ur overwhelmed just with joining the organization…
MC,Am I similar with Rika?
YOOSUNG,I’m not sure about that.
YOOSUNG,You seem softer and more carefree than Rika!
YOOSUNG,Sometimes Rika got so serious that things got a bit chilly~
YOOSUNG,I’m not sure about you yet.
YOOSUNG,We’ll find out more about each other as time passes ^^
MC,I feel a bit strange.
YOOSUNG,Oh. Is it because I kept talking about Rika?
YOOSUNG,I’m sorry.
YOOSUNG,When time passes..
YOOSUNG,I’ll realize that you and Rika are completely strangers to each other.
YOOSUNG,You are so deeply related with Rika that I keep thinking about her.
YOOSUNG,Rika is no longer with us…
YOOSUNG,But it would be so nice to hold the parties again.
YOOSUNG,I’m jealous of you.
YOOSUNG,You are surrounded by traces of her.
YOOSUNG,I really want to go to that apartment too.
MC,I’m going to do whatever I want.
YOOSUNG,Please don’t feel pressured.
YOOSUNG,You always… have the choice.
YOOSUNG,All I ask… is that you care for our organization.
MC,I plan to do my best.
YOOSUNG,Wow. So awesome!
YOOSUNG,I would be so grateful if you could.
MC,I’ll do what I can.
YOOSUNG,Yes. That is enough.
YOOSUNG,Thank you so much for helping.
YOOSUNG,Even tomorrow… you could escape Rika’s apartment…
YOOSUNG,Delete this app
YOOSUNG,and never talk to us again.
YOOSUNG,I would really miss you if that happens.
YOOSUNG,Please… don’t abandon us.
MC,I won’t.
YOOSUNG,^^
YOOSUNG,Thank you.
YOOSUNG,I hope you come here often to chat.
MC,We’ll see.
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,I’ll do better T_T
YOOSUNG,"Don’t abandon RFA, please?"
MC,Only joking ^^ Alright.
YOOSUNG,Whew! haha
YOOSUNG,Okay. Good things will happen if you just enjoy it!
MC,Hmm…
YOOSUNG,Did I offend you?
YOOSUNG,Cheer up~~.
YOOSUNG,I’m going to go take a walk.
YOOSUNG,There’s nothing much to see around my apt..
YOOSUNG,But I like the cold air at night.
MC,Be careful^^
YOOSUNG,Yup! I will.
MC,Laterz
YOOSUNG,Laterz
MC,Good bye.
YOOSUNG,Bye ^^
MC,"Jaehee, you’re still awake."
JAEHEE,You haven’t gone to bed either
JAEHEE,Isn’t it pretty late?
MC,Hello.
JAEHEE,"Hello, MC."
JAEHEE,It’s late.
MC,I’m sleepy…
JAEHEE,Hello.
JAEHEE,"If you are sleepy, what are you doing and not in bed?"
MC,Just cuz…
JAEHEE,Just cuz;;?
JAEHEE,That’s a strange answer.
MC,I’m just sending this before I fall asleep.
JAEHEE,It is best not to touch any electronic device thirty minutes before sleeping.
JAEHEE,The brain must rest.
JAEHEE,I’m glad you came.
JAEHEE,I wanted to talk to you.
JAEHEE,As you well know…
JAEHEE,everyone dearly hopes to hold the party.
JAEHEE,It seems that you have two choices.
JAEHEE,"You escape that place and go back to your daily life, or you stay there and do what you can."
JAEHEE,I… hope that you choose the latter.
JAEHEE,To repeat…
JAEHEE,I hope you take on Rika’s work and carry it on.
MC,I plan to try my best.
JAEHEE,Thank you for saying that.
JAEHEE,You will be happy if you stay with us.
JAEHEE,I… did not voluntarily join the organization either.
JAEHEE,but I have never regretted it.
MC,Could you please explain again what I have to do?
JAEHEE,You will automatically be able to see the emails in Rika’s computer through your phone.
JAEHEE,Possible guests will send you emails…
JAEHEE,"If you convince them or buy them over through your replies, the final guest list will be determined."
JAEHEE,…It will not be too difficult.
MC,I’ll think about it.
JAEHEE,Alright. I understand.
JAEHEE,It is an issue to consider carefully.
JAEHEE,I hope… you decide to stay with us.
JAEHEE,The organization will not disappoint you.
JAEHEE,Who attends our party…
JAEHEE,all depends on you.
JAEHEE,Before you leave…
JAEHEE,Do you have any other questions?
JAEHEE,I cannot tell you about V or Rika…
JAEHEE,but I can share what I know about the other members.
MC,I’m curious of Zen.
JAEHEE,His real name is Hyun Ryu. He does not use this name very often.
JAEHEE,He debuted as a musical actor at a small theater company when he was 16.
JAEHEE,He gained some publicity with the musical ‘Tei’s Tea Leaf’ when he was 19.
JAEHEE,"And until now, he has been gathering many fans with his amazing singing, dancing, and acting skills."
JAEHEE,But he has never held a meet and greet or an event for fans. He hasn’t been involved in any scandal as well.
JAEHEE,His only interest seems to be acting and improving his singing and dancing. Nothing else.
JAEHEE,This is all that is known to the public.
JAEHEE,"In actuality, he is a workaholic man in his 20’s with a dirty mouth but an affectionate heart."
JAEHEE,"In addition, it’s been said that his agency earns more profit from selling photos of him than from ticket sales."
JAEHEE,Zen’s beautiful looks are absolute amongst women.
MC,I am curious of 707.
JAEHEE,707… His real name is Luciel Choi.
JAEHEE,"Surprisingly, Luciel is his baptismal name. No one knows what his name was previous to that."
JAEHEE,There is also not much known about his childhood.
JAEHEE,It seems that he is fairly close to V but no one knows why.
JAEHEE,"He currently works for a foreign intelligence organization or company, and according to him it’s legal."
JAEHEE,He possesses extraordinary hacking skills.
JAEHEE,He also has the talent of making jokes no one understands and subtle insults.
JAEHEE,"It is clear that he is incredibly intelligent, but his crooked attitude of life confuses other members at times."
JAEHEE,…It is difficult just trying to organize information about 707.
JAEHEE,I will stop for now.
MC,I’m curious of Jumin.
JAEHEE,You mean Mr. Han.
JAEHEE,You can say that he was born with a silver spoon.
JAEHEE,"Education fit for an hier, quick promotions, owning company shares.."
JAEHEE,He is no different from other young corporate heirs.
JAEHEE,"But unlike them, Mr. Han…"
JAEHEE,has more than met Mr. Chairman’s demands ever since he was little.
JAEHEE,He is almost excessively loyal to the company.
JAEHEE,He has excellent skills…but it is almost strange that he has no other ambition.
JAEHEE,"To add, he is a bit of a narcissist."
JAEHEE,Just for your information.
MC,I am curious of Yoosung.
JAEHEE,"Yoosung Kim, 20 years old. Currently a student of Sky National University."
JAEHEE,He has no interest in his studies and is whimsical enough to have changed clubs 14 times within a year.
JAEHEE,"With the motto that life should be happy and fun, he pours out his passion to an online game called LoLoL every night"
JAEHEE,Relationship experience nonexistent.
JAEHEE,He has the habit of enjoying his hermit life in dirty hoodies and then crawling out of his cave to proclaim short-lived goals of studying harder and building up his resume.
JAEHEE,"He is innocent and tends to trust people easily, and is at times overly affectionate."
JAEHEE,"He has shown strong affections towards Rika, and has been quiet… antagonistic towards V from the shock of her death."
JAEHEE,"To add, I heard that he is still getting taller."
MC,What kind of person is Jaehee?
JAEHEE,You mean me?
JAEHEE,Strange that you are curious about me…
JAEHEE,"If I have to say, I am the assistant of the Director Jumin Han."
JAEHEE,It has been almost two and a half years since I started working for him.
JAEHEE,"The salary and working environment are better than other companies,"
JAEHEE,and the work is not always boring so I have no plans to quit in the near future.
JAEHEE,I was invited by Mr. Han to join the RFA two years ago.
JAEHEE,"Until you came, I was the only woman in the organization for a while…"
JAEHEE,But I’m skeptical about my feminine side as I was considered a ‘man’ or ‘assistant machine’ or ‘girl next door’.
JAEHEE,I am satisfied with the current situation.
JAEHEE,I hope this answered some of your questions.
JAEHEE,This is all I know.
JAEHEE,It may not be fun chatting with me since I’m a woman…
JAEHEE,but I hope you do not avoid me too much.
MC,I won’t avoid you haha.
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,I hope to remain as a helpful person to you.
MC,You’re fun too.
JAEHEE,Me?
JAEHEE,…I have never heard that before.
JAEHEE,I think you are quite peculiar.
MC,^^
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,Well… Don’t hesitate to tell me
JAEHEE,if you ever feel uncomfortable with me.
JAEHEE,I’ll leave now to get some sleep.
JAEHEE,I hope you enjoy your night.
MC,Good bye~
JAEHEE,Then…
MC,Good night!
JAEHEE,Good night…
MC,Sleep tight.
JAEHEE,Thank you. I hope you do not stay up too late…
MC,Hello~
JAEHEE,You haven’t gone to bed.
JAEHEE,I can’t help but sigh…
MC,"Are you still working, Jaehee?"
JAEHEE,Yes…
JAEHEE,Mr. Han told me he plans to visit my house late after midnight
JAEHEE,so I am waiting…
JAEHEE,But I can’t help but sigh…
MC,Is something up?
JAEHEE,Mr. Han…
JAEHEE,has left Elizabeth the 3rd with me.
JAEHEE,I think I will go crazy.
MC,You get wrinkles if you sigh lol
JAEHEE,I do not care about aging.
JAEHEE,But… Yes.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han is definitely speeding up my aging process.
JAEHEE,He came to my house after midnight to leave his cat with me.
JAEHEE,I thought he had some important matters to discuss.. Isn’t this a bit too much?
MC,It was wrong for him to do that. And visiting you that late at night?
JAEHEE,Yes…
JAEHEE,I am used to him considering my house as a 24/7 convenience store…
JAEHEE,but leaving his cat with me… I really wanted to refuse.
JAEHEE,If he weren’t my boss I would have said no.
MC,I guess you don’t really like cats?
JAEHEE,"No, not really."
JAEHEE,A cat… haha
JAEHEE,"I can ignore everything else, but the hair."
JAEHEE,Cat hair
JAEHEE,In short ‘C-hair’
JAEHEE,The hair is going to all over my apartment and contaminate the air.
JAEHEE,"On my carpet, my sofa!"
JAEHEE,The one strand of hair I see after cleaning my apartment spotless…
JAEHEE,makes me go crazy.
MC,Ask him to pay you extra.
JAEHEE,That would only be fair.
JAEHEE,But Mr. Han…
JAEHEE,thinks that money can solve everything…!
JAEHEE,I tried to refuse but he didn’t listen.
JAEHEE,There are simply some things that cannot be solved with money…
JAEHEE,Yes…
JAEHEE,"In this society,"
JAEHEE,I am only a subordinate.
MC,"Next time, don’t open the door."
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,What if I get fired?
MC,Just get a new job!
JAEHEE,It’s easy for you to say.
JAEHEE,"I am getting older… As I get older, it becomes more difficult to change jobs."
MC,I doubt he’ll fire you. You’re good at your job.
JAEHEE,Oh… Thank you.
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,But… but I don’t want to take a risk with my job.
JAEHEE,I am only a company worker with a low position.
JAEHEE,Anyways… thank you for your consolation.
JAEHEE,Have you gotten used to the organization yet?
MC,Everyone’s been nice so I’m not worried.
JAEHEE,I am sure everyone will be nice since you are a girl.
JAEHEE,I do not fully trust you yet.
JAEHEE,"But… once the mystery is solved, I hope to get to know you better."
MC,Zen’s so sexy I’m gonna get a heart attack.
JAEHEE,That is only to be expected.
JAEHEE,But please keep in mind.
JAEHEE,"He is fairly close to being a being a celebrity, so he must not get involved in any scandals."
JAEHEE,"If you are by any chance harboring risky thoughts, I would like to warn you."
MC,I only want to be Zen’s fan.
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,!!
JAEHEE,Welcome to the club!
JAEHEE,I’m glad to have a kindred spirit…
MC,You seem to be screaming out how much you want to stop being single?
JAEHEE,Do not dare to even dream.
JAEHEE,You are only not aware of
JAEHEE,what is best for you.
JAEHEE,"As someone who cherishes Zen,"
JAEHEE,I would like to prevent all possibilities of him dating.
MC,I am not sure.
JAEHEE,I understand.
JAEHEE,"To be honest, I do not fully trust you yet…"
JAEHEE,But if I were in your position right now
JAEHEE,I would have been more confused.
JAEHEE,Well then… I’ll be off…
JAEHEE,I guess I’ll have to go wrestle with the cat.
MC,Cheer up~!
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,Then…
MC,Good bye.
JAEHEE,Yes. I’ll be off.
MC,"Zen, whassup"
ZEN,Whassup? lol
ZEN,"Naughty girl, you’re still awake."
MC,You’re still awake~
ZEN,Yeah. I doubt I’ll sleep today with all the thoughts in my head.
MC,What were you doing?
ZEN,What was I doing?
ZEN,That’s a good question lol.
MC,When are you going to bed?
ZEN,Well…
ZEN,"If I go to bed right now, I’d probably wake up at…"
ZEN,Maybe 11.
ZEN,lol can’t fall asleep…
ZEN,And that’s all because…
ZEN,Look at this huge pile of fan letters.
ZEN,Oh man~ I had a show last week.
ZEN,"They were all sent to my agency, and I brought them back home today."
ZEN,lol
MC,You must feel good.
ZEN,Yup. I feel good.
ZEN,lololol
ZEN,I guess this is all due to my hard work.
MC,I’m jealous…
ZEN,Nothing to be jealous of.
ZEN,I work every single day to maintain my popularity.
ZEN,It does feel good though lol
ZEN,But still…
ZEN,so what if I have a lot of fans…
ZEN,I can’t get a girlfriend.
ZEN,The director will flip if I get involved in a scandal.
MC,You can date secretly.
ZEN,"Hmm. To be honest, I don’t care about scandals."
ZEN,But if I get forgotten…
ZEN,that will affect my musical team too.
ZEN,I don’t want to cause damage to other people.
ZEN,"If I’m really honest,"
ZEN,"if I do get a girlfriend, I would want to tell the whole world."
ZEN,But…
MC,Does your popularity have anything to do with you getting a girlfriend?
ZEN,Good question.
ZEN,If I was popular just from my acting then it wouldn’t matter…
ZEN,but I feel like I have a lot of fan girls because of my looks.
ZEN,All the fan letters just talk about my looks.
ZEN,God… This face is just…
ZEN,Impossible.
ZEN,"But… if I get a girlfriend, there will be another problem."
MC,Yup. Best to stay safe and focus on work.
ZEN,A lot of people do say that…
ZEN,But I’m worried my youth will just fly by like this.
ZEN,"Even if I date someone right now,"
ZEN,I won’t have time to spend time with her.
ZEN,"All I do is practice everyday, even during weekends."
ZEN,"I feel like I’ll just end up hurting that person, so I don’t date on purpose."
MC,Don’t be so weak. You’re not the only one who is lonely.
ZEN,Hmm… Is that so?
ZEN,I guess…
ZEN,I guess everyone else lives with loneliness too.
MC,That might be best for both people.
ZEN,Yeah.
ZEN,"Still, sometimes I feel so lonely."
ZEN,I do want someone by my side to trust me and cheer me up.
MC,Aren’t the people from the organization enough?
ZEN,No…
ZEN,I want a deeper relationship.
ZEN,A relationship that can embrace all the hurt as well.
MC,That just sounds like you want a girlfriend.
ZEN,Yeah.
ZEN,That’s true lol
ZEN,I really hope the situation improves soon…
ZEN,Even though I’m so busy…
ZEN,Even though I don’t have a girlfriend who can fulfill the deepest part of my heart…
ZEN,The organization members are a huge comfort.
ZEN,Uhm..
ZEN,If RFA were to ever disappear…
ZEN,I might feel as if I’ve lost… my family.
MC,Does your real family live far away?
ZEN,Uhmm…
ZEN,That story will have to wait ^^
MC,It won’t disappear.
ZEN,I really hope not.
ZEN,If we can host parties again thanks to you
ZEN,I doubt it will disappear anytime soon.
ZEN,"Thanks for listening, MC."
ZEN,I have to go warm up my voice.
ZEN,Have a good night. ^^
MC,Good luck~
ZEN,Thank you.
ZEN,Well then…
MC,Good bye.
ZEN,Yup ^^
MC,So sleepy…
YOOSUNG,I was sleepy too when I woke up…
YOOSUNG,But I stretched a bit and now I’m completely awake. ^^
MC,"Good morning, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,"It’s morning, MC!"
YOOSUNG,Did you have breakfast?
MC,Not yet.
YOOSUNG,I guess you’ll eat soon then.
YOOSUNG,I live by myself so I have to cook everything. T_T
YOOSUNG,I…
YOOSUNG,tried making an omelette this morning and completely failed T_T
YOOSUNG,I’ll show you.
YOOSUNG,It’s seriously bad T_T
MC,lololololol Cooking’s not your thing.
YOOSUNG,lololol I know right?
YOOSUNG,I’m so bad
YOOSUNG,at cooking
YOOSUNG,"I even joined the cooking club, but I have zero talent."
YOOSUNG,But still…I!!
YOOSUNG,I’m good at playing games.
YOOSUNG,Can’t I make up for my cooking skills with that?
MC,You can.
YOOSUNG,lol
YOOSUNG,Thanks.
YOOSUNG,But it was silly of me to ask to be honest.
YOOSUNG,You’re very kind.
MC,Looks good.
YOOSUNG,Really?
YOOSUNG,"To be honest, it didn’t taste too bad."
YOOSUNG,I feel much better since you said that haha
YOOSUNG,Look at what Zen said above.
YOOSUNG,Going on and on about not having a girlfriend.
YOOSUNG,"To me, he’s just whining."
MC,You don’t have a girlfriend?
YOOSUNG,…
YOOSUNG,…
YOOSUNG,Gahh… I got so sad I typed ‘…’ twice.
YOOSUNG,I’m sobbing.
YOOSUNG,Don’t do that to me…
YOOSUNG,I’ve
YOOSUNG,never had a girlfriend before.
MC,"Oh my, so innocent~"
YOOSUNG,Why?
YOOSUNG,You’re not innocent?
MC,I’m innocent lol
YOOSUNG,Really?
YOOSUNG,You’re just like me!
YOOSUNG,Hehe…
YOOSUNG,"Anyways, enough of this lonely talk…"
YOOSUNG,I have to go take the school bus now.
YOOSUNG,"Let’s talk later, MC."
MC,Bye~
YOOSUNG,Yup!
MC,Good luck studying.
YOOSUNG,…
MC,"Jumin, did you get your cat?"
JUMIN,Not yet.
JUMIN,I wish I could take her home right this instant.
JAEHEE,Please take her back as soon as you can.
JAEHEE,My house is currently as catastrophe with all the cat hair flying around.
JUMIN,Just vacuum.
JAEHEE,I have already vacuumed six times.
MC,"Jaehee, how is the cat?"
JAEHEE,…The cat is safe.
JUMIN,Of course it is.
JAEHEE,But my house isn’t. It is covered in c-hair.
JUMIN,What do you mean covered in c-hair… She only sheds 3 to 28 strands every ten minutes.
JAEHEE,Did you count that?
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,Anyways.
JUMIN,Yoosung…
JUMIN,has shown off to everyone here that he’s never had a girlfriend.
JUMIN,He could change that status in an instant if he honed his skills like me.
MC,You must have good skills?
JUMIN,My skills?
JUMIN,"It will take around 50 minutes for me to explain, so I will not."
JAEHEE,Please take your cat back if you have the time.
JUMIN,I would even if you didn’t tell me to.
JUMIN,"Anyways, has there been no progress with the party yet?"
JAEHEE,I have not yet heard from V.
MC,When will the date be set?
JUMIN,Hmm. Soon?
JUMIN,"It will be set when V decides he can fully trust you, MC."
JUMIN,"If we do hold the party again, I hope V gets himself together and participates more actively."
JAEHEE,Ever since Rika passed away… he has turned quite timid.
JUMIN,"Still, it’s been a year and a half"
JUMIN,and V’s attitude hasn’t changed at all.
JAEHEE,I think it’s understandable considering he lost… the woman he promised his life to.
JUMIN,Hmph. That boy.
JUMIN,I hope his new photographs are turning out fine.
MC,Did V get depressed?
JUMIN,From the day Rika left this world to now…
JUMIN,he has almost completely stopped participating in RFA.
JUMIN,He doesn’t log into this chatroom very often.
MC,Was V deeply involved with Rika?
JUMIN,"They talked about marriage for awhile, but took it back for some reason."
JAEHEE,It is their private matter…
JAEHEE,But everyone thought that they would spend the rest of their lives together.
JUMIN,Assistant Kang.
JAEHEE,Yes?
JUMIN,Is my Elizabeth the 3rd doing well?
JAEHEE,…I say this every time but it is not proper to leave your cat with me.
JAEHEE,I have a life of my own.
JUMIN,Just consider it a part of your job.
JUMIN,Find comfort in the money that goes into your bank account.
MC,It’s not about money. You have to respect Jaehee’s private life too.
JAEHEE,Oh… Thank you for saying so.
JAEHEE,I’m quite surprised that you said that.
JAEHEE,It is just as MC said.
JAEHEE,And it is difficult for me to accept that taking care of your cat is part of my job.
JUMIN,"Since when did you start taking sides with Jaehee, MC?"
JAEHEE,I do not think MC is taking anyone’s side in particular.
JUMIN,Hmm.
MC,"Jaehee, money’s the best~"
JUMIN,Yes. You must earn as much as you can when you can.
JUMIN,And money tends to bring more money.
JUMIN,It is best to save consistently and invest wisely.
JUMIN,If you were not born with a silver spoon in your mouth.
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,I’ll take the message by heart hearing it from someone who was born with a silver spoon.
JAEHEE,Anyways
JAEHEE,I can handle everything else but the c-fur -_-
JUMIN,Do not treat Elizabeth the 3rd’s sacred hair that way.
JUMIN,You should be thinking of collecting them carefully to knit a scarf.
JUMIN,Oh… That is actually a very good idea.
JUMIN,A handmade scarf made from scattered cat hair…!
MC,lolol
JUMIN,Talking about it makes me want to get one.
JUMIN,Should I write a business proposal?
JUMIN,"Assistant Kang, write a rough draft."
JAEHEE,We should talk about it later once this job is finished.
JUMIN,Haha…
JUMIN,"Anyways, so Elizabeth the 3rd is safe."
MC,I see the being an assistant is very hard…
JAEHEE,"Yes, basically I am the modern slave."
JUMIN,I prefer a classic slave more.
JAEHEE,So what?
JUMIN,"To be honest, I am against slavery."
JAEHEE,What are you talking about?
JUMIN,I’m just saying whatever that comes into my mind.
JAEHEE,Are you being possessed by Seven?
JUMIN,What an insult.
JAEHEE,I think you should leave for work.
JUMIN,"Before that, I must know this."
JUMIN,There wasn’t any male cat intruding and making a commotion?
JAEHEE,Of course there wasn’t…
JAEHEE,"Anyways, please take your cat back at noon sharp."
JAEHEE,I have to leave for work in the afternoon.
JUMIN,"Oh, right."
JUMIN,I’ll take the car to your place at noon.
JAEHEE,"Please hurry, Mr. Han."
JAEHEE,I must go to work soon.
JUMIN,Go to work with me.
MC,"Jaehee, I’m glad it’s almost over for you haha."
JAEHEE,Oh… Thank you.
JAEHEE,Never thought anyone would acknowledge how difficult this is…
JUMIN,I guess I’m good since I acknowledge with money.
JUMIN,…
MC,Hope you take her back safe~
JUMIN,Of course I will.
JUMIN,"Then, I’ll get going."
JAEHEE,"I will get ready. MC, have a good day."
MC,Gah… I’m hungry.
YOOSUNG,"Omg, you didn’t have lunch yet!"
YOOSUNG,You can’t skip lunch~!
MC,"Yoosung, did you have lunch?"
YOOSUNG,Yup I did~
YOOSUNG,lol I see Jahee and Jumin had another fuss because of the cat.
YOOSUNG,I think that cat is really living a good life.
MC,"Please be my cat, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,…I’m blushing.
YOOSUNG,Will you feed me and put me to sleep?
MC,Ya
YOOSUNG,Then please adopt me…lol
YOOSUNG,I’ll listen to whatever you say lol
MC,Haha yeah.
YOOSUNG,So jealous… lol
YOOSUNG,I want to be Jumin’s cat in my next life…
YOOSUNG,But Seven hasn’t showed up since last night.
MC,I guess he’s busy.
YOOSUNG,I’m sure…
YOOSUNG,I don’t know what he does but he’s always busy lol
MC,Do you miss him? lol
YOOSUNG,No way;;
YOOSUNG,"If you get on his bad side, he’ll get you hard."

YOOSUNG,But I had too much breakfast so I’m just sitting on a bench by myself.
YOOSUNG,The sky is so clear today.
YOOSUNG,I hope… Rika is well?
MC,I’m sure she’s well.
YOOSUNG,Thank you.
YOOSUNG,You’re really kind.
YOOSUNG,I didn’t bring any of my books or my assignments today.
YOOSUNG,I was too distracted with cooking this morning that I left without anything lol

ZEN,Stop pretending to be cute. Take those emojis away.
707,"Oh, our celebrity, Zen is here lol"
MC,"Zen, hello."
ZEN,"MC, did this guy say anything strange?"
707,I didn’t lol. U can look at the chat history.
707,I’m innocent >_<
707,Just read the messages above. Jumin must have left his cat with Jaehee again lolol
707,I feel nothing but love for that cat
707,Can’t understand what’s up with Jaehee lol
ZEN,-_- I’ve said this many times but I hate cats.
ZEN,I don’t even like that trust fund kid coming near me. He smells like cats.
ZEN,That rich dude… kind of looks like a cat too.
MC,You don’t like cats?
ZEN,Nope. I don’t like them…
ZEN,I cough when they come near me.
707,You mean you sneeze lol achew achew
ZEN,Get rid of that cat picture -_-
707,But it’s so cute lol
MC,"Which of you hate more, Jumin or cats?"
707,lololol which do u hate more lolol
707,Ur basically saying that Jumin’s the same as cats lmaooo
ZEN,lol I like what MC said.
ZEN,Hmm… To answer the question
ZEN,I hate them both equally.
ZEN,I never liked Jumin…
ZEN,but because of my allergy just looking at cats makes me feel like I’m about to die!
707,lololol u still haven’t gotten over ur fur allergy? lolol
ZEN,Stop laughing. It’s serious!
ZEN,And you do not overcome an allergy…
ZEN,Your body doesn’t change!
ZEN,I already don’t like that dude and that cat is bugging me more.
707,lolololol But cats r so cute tho
ZEN,I remember he called you a cat abuser;; Am I remembering wrong?
707,I never abuse her~~ I just play with her.
ZEN,How?
707,I just well~~~ hug~~~ her
707,and~~~ rub my cheeks on her
707,and~~ hug her
707,and run in circles
707,and I run around with her in my arms lol
MC,I think that’s abuse…
ZEN,Yes. That is abuse.
ZEN,Stop harassing the cat and leave her alone.
ZEN,Let Jumin live with that thing.
MC,You must really like cats!
ZEN,-_-
ZEN,Are you similar to Seven…
707,lol she gets me! yay!
ZEN,Anyways.
ZEN,How is his company going?
707,Jumin’s been showing better results so Mr. Chairman went abroad to play golf lol
ZEN,That dude has to bring in good people again for the party to be a success…
707,Oh~ Yeah. That’s true.
MC,Mr. Chairman? …Golf?
ZEN,He’s the company chairman’s son.
ZEN,I think the oldest son?
707,Dunno. Don’t remember.
ZEN,Yeah right. You know everything about us.
707,No… Pay me if u want me to know…
ZEN,You already have enough money… You changed your car recently.
707,U don’t know car poor? Car hobo.
MC,What are you talking about?
ZEN,Oh. A lot of the people that the Director dude brings to the party
707,I heard they have a lot of money meow~
ZEN,Don’t meow -_-
ZEN,"Anyways, that dude has connections to big money."
707,Big profit for the party meow.
ZEN,Yes. That’s true.
707,Gahh… I got to work. I have to go lol
MC,What work?
707,U want to know?
707,But!
707,It’s~ a secret~.
ZEN,Okay. Bye. I have to leave too.
707,Get it on you two.
ZEN,What are you talking about
707,Bye~
ZEN,He’s gone.
MC,What do you think he meant?
ZEN,I think it’s because I talked about being single too much.
ZEN,Did you have lunch?
MC,Not yet
ZEN,Really?
ZEN,You have to eat well..
MC,Yes.
ZEN,Good lol.
ZEN,I ate beef stir fry.
ZEN,"You’re important to us now, so"
ZEN,"please take care of your health, okay?"
MC,Alright. Thank you for your concern.
ZEN,You know…
ZEN,I’m glad that you’re here.
ZEN,Even though Jaehee or the other members don’t fully trust you yet
ZEN,I don’t think for a second that you could be a bad person.
ZEN,I want to stay longer but I have to go.
ZEN,Let’s talk soon MC.
ZEN,Bye.
MC,"Hello, V."
V,Hello.
MC,Wow… It’s really you!
V,Are you surprised?
V,I apologize for not coming into this chatroom often.
V,Have you had any trouble continuing Rika’s work?
MC,I’m trying.
V,I apologize if I burdened you further.
MC,I’m not sure yet.
V,"Well, you just started so that is to be expected."
V,I was reading all the previous messages.
V,"The expectations toward the party, the talk about Rika…"
V,I read everything.
ZEN,Huh? It’s V.
V,Hyun. You’re here.
V,I had some time to spare so I came.
ZEN,"Hey, MC."
ZEN,It’s so weird that us three are in this chatroom together.
MC,"Hello, Zen~!"
ZEN,Hi. Did you eat?
MC,Yes.
ZEN,Good ^^
MC,I know…
ZEN,It’s strange because V doesn’t come into this chatroom very often.
V,Haha…
MC,Hyun?
ZEN,Oh;; That’s my real name.
ZEN,V likes to call us by our real names lol
V,"Maybe it’s because I’m old school, but I like calling everyone by their names."
ZEN,lololol
ZEN,We call call each other by our usernames… I feel awkward hearing my name lol
ZEN,"V, come chat with us more often."
ZEN,I have no idea what you’re up to.
ZEN,Send us some pictures so we know how you’re doing at least.
V,I will try…
ZEN,As you know
ZEN,everyone’s excited about the party.
V,"You need plans for the party, right?"
ZEN,Yeah…
ZEN,When it will be… how big it will be
ZEN,We all want to know.
V,It’s only been two days since we started talking about the party again
V,so can you give me some more time?
ZEN,You need more time?
V,It’s… something to think more about. Give me time.
V,"Surprisingly, I’ve been receiving calls from some of the previous party guests. They have asked me about the plan of the party."
ZEN,What?
ZEN,We didn’t even mention that we’re holding a party
ZEN,and you’re already getting calls from them?
MC,Someone must know that I’ve joined RFA.
V,There’s no way the information leaked outside of the organization..
ZEN,In my guess
ZEN,I think it might be related with the person who led MC to Rika’s apartment.
V,Yes. I think the same.
MC,That’s actually suspicious…
ZEN,Really?
ZEN,How did they find out about the party?
V,Well…
MC,"Someone’s not watching me, right?"
V,Security cameras are placed everywhere outside the apartment.
V,"If anything seems strange, I or Luciel will know right away."
V,We are doing our best to make sure nothing bad happens.
V,I will guarantee your safety.
ZEN,That makes me feel better.
ZEN,"MC, you can trust what V says."
V,It is clear that someone outside the organization knows about MC.
ZEN,I really hope we figure out who that Unknown guy is…!
V,The reason why I need more time to set plans for the party is…
V,I want to start the work after we’ve secured MC’s safety as much as possible.
ZEN,First… I understand what you’re saying.
ZEN,MC can’t be put in danger.
V,Yes.
MC,How bad can it be?
ZEN,You’re brave…
ZEN,I’d feel a bit scared to be honest;;
V,I will make sure nothing serious happens.
V,Luciel and I are doing our best to find a way.
MC,I’m a bit scared.. T_T
ZEN,Of course you’re scared…
ZEN,I’d feel scared too.
V,Do not worry.
V,"If any device other than your smartphone attempts to access Rika’s apartment, we’ll know right away."
V,Luciel knows the location of the apartment and he’ll call security immediately.
ZEN,Oh.. You won’t have any problems with that guy involved lol
V,Yes.
MC,Thank you for caring.
V,No need. It’s what I ought to do.
V,We only confused you…
V,by involving you in RFA without any official procedure.
ZEN,MC won’t think that way.
MC,Don’t think that way. I’m fine.
ZEN,See. ^^
V,You are very kind.
ZEN,"As you said, the most important thing is to secure MC’s safety."
ZEN,To talk about the party again…
ZEN,We all want you to be as bright as you were before.
ZEN,I hope you get to smile more with this party.
ZEN,I still clearly remember how happy you looked when working with Rika.
MC,I guess V used to be more active before.
ZEN,Yes. Much more active than now…
ZEN,I miss those times.
ZEN,It would be nice… if only we could go back to how things were.
MC,I think it will be fun. I hope we get to hold the party again.
ZEN,"I agree, MC."
V,"Thank you, both of you."
ZEN,Try to cheer up a bit…
ZEN,Of course… I know you have many reasons why it’s hard to.
V,I appreciate your concerns…
V,but sadly you cannot turn back time.
V,If only we could… we’d have done everything differently.
V,I’ll try to set the schedule regarding the party soon.
V,Hyun.
ZEN,Yeah?
V,Thanks for worrying.
ZEN,I’m not the only one…
ZEN,Everyone feels the same way.
V,I’ll make sure to meet up to that trust.
V,No matter what happens.
V,I have to leave now. I have dinner plans with Rui.
MC,Rui?
V,Oh. He’s a photographer I work with from time to time.
V,"If possible, I’ll talk about the party too. He might be able to help us."
ZEN,"Oh, I remember. He is the famous person who said he was my fan."
V,Don’t skip meals even if you’re busy. You lose everything if you lose your health.
V,"Please take care of yourself too, MC."
MC,I will. Thank you.
V,As long as you are a member of the organization… you are like my family.
V,We don’t know each other very well yet.
V,but I think we will get closer as time passes.
ZEN,That’s touching. Nice of you to say that.
ZEN,V.
ZEN,If you were to leave this organization… you know that all of us will leave too.
V,I know.
V,Let’s talk later.
ZEN,Okay.
ZEN,He’s gone…
ZEN,Wasn’t that a bit flustering?
ZEN,Talking with V all of a sudden…
MC,I wasn’t too flustered.
ZEN,You’re really something. You know that?
ZEN,You’re used to everything already.
MC,I was thankful that he worried for me.
ZEN,Yeah. V has a kind heart.
ZEN,I’m sure V wants to hold the party right this instant if he could.
ZEN,Except… I guess he’s still healing his wounds.
ZEN,The wounds from losing the person he loved…
MC,I hope he cheers up soon.
ZEN,I hope so too.
MC,He must have loved her deeply.
ZEN,Yeah. They talked about getting married.
ZEN,The best happy ending would be…
ZEN,"MC, you’re safe,"
ZEN,"we hold the party again,"
ZEN,V cheers up…
ZEN,and everyone feels happy.
ZEN,Just like how it was then.
ZEN,Oh…
ZEN,I really have to go now. I still have some things to finish.
MC,Good bye.
ZEN,Bye.
MC,"See you later, Zen."
ZEN,Yeah.
ZEN,Had fun talking to you.
ZEN,Let’s talk again. ^^
MC,"Oh, it’s Seven."
707,"Oh, it’s MC."
MC,707 has entered.
707,MC has entered.
707,lolol I get to talk with MC.
707,So exciting~.
707,I feel good cuz I finished work earlier than I expected.
MC,Awesome possum
707,lol
707,Huh? But…
707,V came here haha
MC,Yes. But he left soon.
707,I wanted to talk to V!
MC,You wanted to see V?
707,Yes.
707,It’s been so long since I saw his face…
707,I’m gonna forget what he looks like soon.
707,I really hope he tells us the plans fast
707,and we get to hold the party again haha
707,Then so many fun things will happen~~
MC,What fun things?
707,Hmm lol
707,For example…
707,The company I work for right now never gives me days off…
707,But they’ll be forced to give me a holiday.
707,So excited to see the boss’ angry face.
MC,Forced to give you a holiday…?
707,…It just means I’m ditching work for a week without asking ^^
707,lololol
MC,That doesn’t sound too good;
707,Why~
707,I don’t have to go to work during the party lol
707,I want to go to have the party soon~~
YOOSUNG,Hiya
707,Howdy
YOOSUNG,Are you a cowboy or sth? roflol’
MC,Hey~ Hey~
YOOSUNG,omg lol
YOOSUNG,Hey lol
MC,"Nice to see you, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,"MC, you were here too."
707,V came and went. Look at the messages above.
YOOSUNG,Ya?
YOOSUNG,Oh… V.
YOOSUNG,He really did come…
707,He must have seen everything we said about the party.
707,Since MC joined the organization
707,we were pretty busy just talking about the party.
707,If Yoosung stopped playing games because he was thinking about the party
YOOSUNG,omg
707,that says it all.
YOOSUNG,I’m not that addicted to games lol
YOOSUNG,Hmm…
YOOSUNG,When do you think we’ll have specific plans for the party?
707,I hope it’s soon.
MC,"We’ll find out soon, I guess."
YOOSUNG,I hopes so.
707,It’s being delayed because of security issues.
YOOSUNG,Then I guess V wants to hold the party?
707,Ya. Seems so.
MC,Or… you can just hang with me and chat. lol
707,lololol that’s positive~!
YOOSUNG,If we don’t get to hold the party again…
YOOSUNG,"your access might be denied, MC."
707,omg that’s too harsh!
707,Who the hell would do that.
YOOSUNG,Since Seven’s responsible
YOOSUNG,he’ll go to where you are and cut off access -_-
707,!?
YOOSUNG,Stop pretending. You’re the technician.
707,Oh the tragic fate of an employee…
YOOSUNG,Yeah yeah. You’re gonna do whatever V tells you to do anyways.
707,W…
YOOSUNG,"W, what?"
707,I don’t know how it’s gonna play out…
707,But I want the party fast~
YOOSUNG,Me too.
YOOSUNG,Jaehee didn’t seem to be up for it at first
YOOSUNG,but I think it’s just because she doesn’t trust MC. I think she wants the party too.
YOOSUNG,Oh. It’s Jumin.
707,I want to give a 90’s greeting~
YOOSUNG,Hiya
707,"Yo, yo, homie Joe."
MC,Hello.
JUMIN,You’re the only one to give me a proper greeting.
MC,Hey
YOOSUNG,lolol
JUMIN,-_-
JUMIN,I’m tired.
JUMIN,Assistant Kang!
YOOSUNG,She’s not here…?
MC,Hmm? What do you think she’s doing?
707,I say she’s watching a DVD.
YOOSUNG,Cooking?
JUMIN,I do not really want to know what she’s doing right now.
MC,Jaehee has a life of her own;
JUMIN,I’m not invading her personal life.
JUMIN,I am caller her during working hours set by the law.
707,"And the law says that work hours are from 00 to 24, right?"
JUMIN,God…
JUMIN,Elizabeth the 3rd hasn’t been eating anything since she came back from Assistant Kang’s place.
JUMIN,I have to call her.
YOOSUNG,Why don’t you call her rather than going online?
707,Since he can take care of things without hearing her voice?
707,"How’s school for ya, Yoosung?"
YOOSUNG,Fine
YOOSUNG,But I fell asleep during geography today.
YOOSUNG,I’m worried about my GPA T_T I hate GE classes!!!
MC,You have to study hard to earn a proper living.
YOOSUNG,Wow… I have another person…
YOOSUNG,nagging me to study.
707,I’m not good at studying too.
YOOSUNG,You’re…
YOOSUNG,a genius/b]
YOOSUNG,-_-
YOOSUNG,You messing with me?
MC,I’m bad at geography too lol
YOOSUNG,"Oh, really?"
YOOSUNG,I’m…
YOOSUNG,bad at everything ^^
707,lololol love the honesty
MC,What subject do you like?
YOOSUNG,Hmm…
YOOSUNG,Hmm?
707,Maybe u have zero interest?
YOOSUNG,Pretty much.
707,lol Don’t worry too much.
707,If you end up hacking beyond national borders you get to memorize world geography pretty quick.
YOOSUNG,Gahh… I want to get out of school fast.
YOOSUNG,It’s not as if getting a job becomes easier if you study hard.
707,I heard young people these days are depressed because of things like that.
YOOSUNG,Seven talks as if he’s not young.
JUMIN,A cat abuser cannot be considered a normal member of the youth.
YOOSUNG,omg… Jumin suddenly started talking lol
707,lololol
707,It’s a problem that Yoosung doesn’t have a girlfriend.
707,It’s also a problem that Yoosung’s addicted to games.
707,It’s another problem that Yoosung’s struggling with problems faced by the youth these days.
707,It’s a huge problem that Yoosung doesn’t like V.
707,Yoosung has so many problems.
YOOSUNG,It’s not my problem that I don’t like V.
YOOSUNG,V’s the one who gave me the reason for not liking him. 
MC,Is Yoosung not getting along with V?
707,"Well, they aren’t really on good terms…"
YOOSUNG,I don’t hate V for no reason.
YOOSUNG,Everyone seems to be fine with V…
YOOSUNG,"To me, that’s more strange."
MC,Did V do something wrong?
YOOSUNG,Yes. I think he did something wrong.
707,;;;
707,Yoosung was really close with Rika
YOOSUNG,We weren’t just close
YOOSUNG,I am her actual family.
YOOSUNG,Jumin got rid of his tears quickly.
YOOSUNG,Even though Rika wasn’t with us anymore
YOOSUNG,he got over it so soon…
YOOSUNG,Managed to do his work without a problem.
YOOSUNG,He’s doing even better now.
YOOSUNG,Same with V… they both got over it so fast.
YOOSUNG,"Not just Jumin, everyone got over it so fast."
707,That is true…
YOOSUNG,I was connected to her by blood.
707,Now that I think about it…
YOOSUNG,It was unbearable for me.
707,"Yoosung, u were really messed up by it."
YOOSUNG,It’s natural that everyone doesn’t feel the way I do.
YOOSUNG,I was practically her little brother.
YOOSUNG,If V truly loved Rika
707,Omg;
YOOSUNG,If he really considered her family…
YOOSUNG,he wouldn’t have gotten over it so fast…
707,I don’t know…
707,He wasn’t… exactly well.
707,V too…
707,"Even now,"
YOOSUNG,…
MC,"I heard that if people get really sad, they get colder instead."
YOOSUNG,Really?
YOOSUNG,But even if that’s true
YOOSUNG,V did a lot of things I can’t understand.
MC,Maybe V knows something that you don’t…
YOOSUNG,Oh! I actually did think that.
YOOSUNG,V was so strangely calm;;;
YOOSUNG,Maybe… he knows something I don’t?
YOOSUNG,I did… think that a lot.
707,Endless misunderstandings
JUMIN,Hey. I’m back…
707,Is our cute Elizabeth doing well?
JUMIN,I think Assistant Kang fed her too much.
JUMIN,And do not talk about her as if she is your cat.
JUMIN,Someone who abuses cats has no right to talk that way.
JUMIN,And Yoosung.
YOOSUNG,Yes?
JUMIN,However V dealt with Rika’s death…
JUMIN,I don’t think it’s something for you to judge.
JUMIN,I’m not defending V but…
JUMIN,You have to acknowledge that V has his own way of grieving.
YOOSUNG,Well.
YOOSUNG,I don’t know.
YOOSUNG,Stopping the parties that Rika held
YOOSUNG,and almost breaking up the organization…
YOOSUNG,Do you think it was because he couldn’t bear to think about her?
YOOSUNG,"It wasn’t just that, he got rid of all traces of her."
YOOSUNG,"Her photos, records, everything."
YOOSUNG,I don’t think there’s anything left other than the things in her apartment.
YOOSUNG,If he knew the password to the apartment
YOOSUNG,he would have gone in and burned everything.
YOOSUNG,V used to be… so nice…
YOOSUNG,But now…
MC,Maybe he had his own reasons.
YOOSUNG,…To be honest
YOOSUNG,I really hope so.
YOOSUNG,If there’s something I don’t know
YOOSUNG,and I’m just misunderstanding…
YOOSUNG,I would feel so much better.
707,omg
707,It’s scary watching Yoosung explode
707,If u get older…
707,u become more numb to things like that.
YOOSUNG,You’re not that much older than me.
JUMIN,I do not think that V has changed that much.
JUMIN,Although I admit that he has become more dry.
707,I feel that he may be hiding something
707,but I don’t think that he’s changed a lot.
YOOSUNG,"You think that too, Seven?"
YOOSUNG,I do too.
MC,I want to see how things go.
707,That’s what I’m doing right now.
MC,I want to trust V.
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,What do you mean V’s hiding something…;
JUMIN,Young people are so suspicious.
707,Everyone knows that Yoosung doesn’t really like V.
707,That’s nothing new~.
707,A brother hating the sister’s husband is
707,a cliche soap opera story.
MC,"Seven, maybe you watched too many soap operas? lol"
YOOSUNG,Ya…
MC,Classic sister complex…
707,Ya
YOOSUNG,-_- What’s that
MC,Quit being suspicious of each other~
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,"The more you think, the issues will only become deeper."
YOOSUNG,…
YOOSUNG,Let’s move on for now.
YOOSUNG,"Seven, did you find the hacker who made MC go to the apartment?"
707,Hmm~.
707,I did try tracing him…
707,but didn’t find much.
YOOSUNG,There’s something that even you can’t trace?
JUMIN,Maybe you’ve lost your skills?
JUMIN,You’re being punished for abusing my cat.
MC,Seven seems to need the cat’s blessing.
707,"Thanks for saying, MC."
707,But to be honest…
MC,Ya
JUMIN,Elizabeth the 3rd’s curse seems to have worked.
707,Nah
MC,We must protect animals.
YOOSUNG,Agreed!
707,It’s not really about that…
707,I kept digging and it seemed…
707,to be related to a religious organization.
707,I was about to look into it more… but I’m just going to keep an eye out for now.
YOOSUNG,Religious?
JUMIN,That’s a sensitive area.
MC,"I’ll be okay, right? T_T"
YOOSUNG,What if something happens to MC?
707,"Nah, that’ll never happen."
707,V will protect her for sure lol
YOOSUNG,How?
707,Using Jumin’s money and his connections?
JUMIN,My money??
MC,I think he mentioned something about religion…
707,Really?
707,Hmm~.
707,"Okay, I’ll keep that in mind."
707,I’ll have to collect more data.
707,The information isn’t conclusive yet so don’t overreact.
707,"If it’s related to Rika, I’ll make sure to tell u."
YOOSUNG,Okay… Alright.
YOOSUNG,It must be hard for you.
707,lol nothing’s hard~ it’s dine.
707,I’ll go get some shut eye now.
MC,Already?
YOOSUNG,Yeah…
YOOSUNG,It’s still early evening…
707,I stayed up all night working till this afternoon T_T
707,I can’t even keep my eyes open right now…
YOOSUNG,Got it. Hurry and go to bed.
YOOSUNG,"You’re not skipping meals though, right?"
707,Nah. Got a burger.
JUMIN,Commoner food… it must be high cholesterol.
707,I’m gonna work hard and die fast.
707,Have no desire to live long lol
YOOSUNG,Whaaat??
MC,"Still, you should eat properly;;"
YOOSUNG,Ya… You should.
707,lol aight.
MC,Sleep tight like a baby sheep.
YOOSUNG,Baby sheep;;
JUMIN,-_-
707,Mehhh~~
707,"Anyways, bye~"
JUMIN,Good bye.
YOOSUNG,No desire to live long;;;
YOOSUNG,But.
YOOSUNG,"Jumin, you don’t eat burgers because it’s commoner food? ^^;"
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,I was educated as a child not to eat things like that.
JUMIN,It became a habit and I still don’t have the desire to try it.
MC,He must be from a super rich family…
JUMIN,Yes. That’s correct.
YOOSUNG,"lololol you’re so cute, MC."
MC,I prefer fried chicken and wine too lol
JUMIN,What’s fried chicken?
YOOSUNG,How can you not know fried chicken as a Korean!!
YOOSUNG,…Chicken that’s fried in oil. You really don’t know?
JUMIN,Is it different from pork stir fry?
YOOSUNG,-_-
YOOSUNG,So bougie
JUMIN,Do you even know what that means?
YOOSUNG,;;
JUMIN,Anyways it is not good to be picky about food.
JUMIN,I have to leave now.

ZEN,I feel as if she wrote it while thinking of me lol
MC,lmafoooooo
ZEN,Why are you laughing -_-
ZEN,"Look at this and ponder my charm, MC."
YOOSUNG,Get losyt
YOOSUNG,was too honest ytypho
ZEN,It’s a man who must love one woman to protect his one and only sister.
ZEN,I’m worried whether or not I can express that deep anguish
YOOSUNG,Ya soudnds fugn
ZEN,I should map out a lot of things for the character.
ZEN,The director has high hopes for this.
YOOSUNG,ye
ZEN,"Yoosung, what do you think?"
YOOSUNG,Ye?
ZEN,My new role. Do you think I’ll pull it off?
YOOSUNG,Zen
ZEN,Yeah

ZEN,Help me practice my lines when you have time.
ZEN,If I read my lines to you… I’ll feel so good. lol
ZEN,Then I’ll carry on that excitement
ZEN,and go read the proposal some more now. ^^
MC,Anytime ^^
ZEN,lol excited.
ZEN,I’ll be off now ^^
MC,Okay. Good bye~
ZEN,Bye~
MC,"Zen, are you practicing your lines?"
ZEN,Oh… yes.
ZEN,I was reading the script.
ZEN,There’s a lot of content in here.
ZEN,I thought I should at least have the character figured out.
ZEN,"Oh, right."
ZEN,MC.
ZEN,It doesn’t seem that small.
ZEN,And there are quite a lot of talented people in it too.
MC,You want me to join?
ZEN,No lol
ZEN,Nothing like that.
MC,Then why are you telling me..?
ZEN,You are working in Rika’s place. ^^
ZEN,Nothing specific has been decided about the party
ZEN,but it’s nice to have a list of guests beforehand.
ZEN,Should I contact them… and tell them to send and email to RFA?
MC,Sounds good.
ZEN,Okay. I’ll tell them.
ZEN,If you talk to them and don’t really feel sure…
ZEN,You can be the judge and respond ^^
ZEN,"Anyways, I want to be a helpful person to you."
ZEN,I’ll tell you if I find anything else ^^
ZEN,I’ll go and read the script again.
MC,Looking forward to your awesome performance.
ZEN,Okay.
ZEN,Thank you for encouraging words ^^
MC,"Hello, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,"Hello, MC."
MC,"How did the cat issue go, Jaehee?"
JAEHEE,Gahh… I was just going through that right now.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han called me around 27 minutes ago
JAEHEE,to complain about how she is shedding more than usual.
JAEHEE,"Of course, I did nothing wrong,"
JAEHEE,but I hope he never leaves his cat with me after this incident.
JAEHEE,I see that Zen got a new role.
JAEHEE,An actor with both acting skills and good looks…
JAEHEE,His career is soaring.
MC,I’m not really interested in that…
JAEHEE,I see.
MC,I think Zen’s pretty handsome lol
JAEHEE,…That is a matter of taste.
JAEHEE,But it is not good to judge people by their looks.
JAEHEE,"Of course, I am by no means saying that Zen’s looks are not extraordinary."
MC,I think so too.
JAEHEE,Yes.
JAEHEE,His acting was applauded even when he was not famous.
JAEHEE,Talent will always be recognized.
JAEHEE,"What do you think of Zen, MC?"
MC,I’m not sure yet. I haven’t known him for long.
JAEHEE,I see.
JAEHEE,Of course.
JAEHEE,But I would like to say this just in case.
MC,Why are you asking?
JAEHEE,…I was only asking to be cautious.
JAEHEE,It is not good to have feelings for a celebrity.
JAEHEE,The fans will be extremely jealous.
JAEHEE,It will only be difficult for both people.
MC,I don’t have feelings for Zen.
JAEHEE,Alright.
JAEHEE,Then never mind what I said.
MC,It’s nothing like that~. Don’t worry.
JAEHEE,I’m glad to hear that…
JAEHEE,"As a member of the same organization, I hope you protect Zen with me…"
MC,It’s none of your business.
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,Members of the RFA are not strangers.
JAEHEE,Anyways… it seems that you’re not in a very good mood
JAEHEE,so I’ll try not to offend you.
JAEHEE,After conducting some simple research…
JAEHEE,I discovered that the original writer of the play Zen is a part of is a member of a fairly large organization.
JAEHEE,My worry is that…
JAEHEE,considering their age group and the novels they’ve written…
JAEHEE,It’s likely that they will ask too much from Zen.
JAEHEE,I should warn Zen beforehand.
MC,"Jaehee, do you have feelings for Zen?"
JAEHEE,What?
JAEHEE,It’s… nothing like that.
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,I simply admire Zen
JAEHEE,I do not have feelings for hitm!
MC,You have a typo.
JAEHEE,"Well, I know. I’m human and I make mistakes."
MC,Zen will be thankful.
JAEHEE,I do not really… expect gratitude.
JAEHEE,I am only doing what I ought to do as a member of the organization.
JAEHEE,Anyways I…
JAEHEE,want to encourage Zen’s career.
MC,You have a kind heart.
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,"Although, I do not do this to hear such compliments."
MC,I’ll cheer with you.
JAEHEE,…Yes. Well.
JAEHEE,Do as you please.
JAEHEE,I understand how you feel.
JAEHEE,I will have to leave now to prepare for tomorrow.
MC,It was nice talking to you. ^^
JAEHEE,Yes. I had a little fun as well.
MC,I’ll be off too.
JAEHEE,Good bye.
JAEHEE,Bye.
MC,"Zen, you’re up pretty late."
ZEN,Yeah ^^
ZEN,I just came here to take a break.
MC,"707, what are you doing this late at night?"
707,Spying.
ZEN,-_-
ZEN,You seem creepier than ever.
707,Just kidding~ lol
ZEN,Don’t you think Jaehee’s pretty interested in my new project?
707,She’s ur fan.
ZEN,Nah~
ZEN,She just cares for me because I’m a member.
ZEN,No way a smart assistant of a gigantic conglomerate Director is my fan.
707,lololol
707,How comical.
707,He’s denying what she’s trying so hard to make clear.
MC,I think she’s your fan.
ZEN,Really?
ZEN,Nah~ No way.
ZEN,"MC, aren’t you my fan?"
MC,I am your fan ^^
ZEN,Thought so!
ZEN,Haha
ZEN,Feels good lol
MC,I think she has personal feelings for you.
ZEN,What??
707,lololol
ZEN,It’s nothing;;;
707,lololol
ZEN,Why are you just laughing.
707,lolol
ZEN,It’s not that…
ZEN,"Besides, even though I am quite charming"
ZEN,Someone who’s born from a good family would suit Jaehee better.
ZEN,I’m not really the elite type lol
707,MC.
707,Can I ask u a question?
707,What kind of a woman do you think would suit me?
MC,lololololololol
707,lololololololol
707,Sorry lololol
MC,A witty and creative alien?
ZEN,"lololol MC, ur funny lolol"
707,Alien…
ZEN,Yup. I think you two would be the perfect couple.
ZEN,The perfect girl for you… lol
ZEN,…I think someone who wears glasses and uses funny languages would suit you.
ZEN,MC.
ZEN,What kind of girl would be perfect for me?
707,Someone brave!
MC,A sensible woman.
ZEN,Yes~! Being sensible is so important.
ZEN,You know my taste very well lol
MC,An obedient woman.
ZEN,Uhm… I’m not old school. I don’t think that way.
707,Don’t u dare ignore a woman’s sixth sense yo
707,Coreana sitting across from next next next to me said so yo
ZEN,No…
ZEN,And who the hell’s Coreana?;;
ZEN,A pretty and obedient girl is every foolish man’s dream.
ZEN,I’m not foolish.
707,Maybe u r foolish
ZEN,Not -_-
707,The absolute truth is that
707,all women who care for looks will definitely like you lol
ZEN,I’m a bit offended.
ZEN,Is there nothing to me other than my looks?!
707,Just admit it lolol
707,U make a living out of people who care for looks lolol
707,Ur youtube views are all because of ur face lol
MC,Your looks do play a huge part.
ZEN,T_T
ZEN,…I am a bit…
ZEN,handsome.
707,ermahgerd
MC,"But if he weren’t talented, his good looks might have played against him."
ZEN,Right? I knew MC would have my back.
ZEN,But it’s also true that I totally look like a movie star.
ZEN,lolololololololol
ZEN,Sorry… MC made me feel a bit good about myself.
ZEN,"While it’s true that I’m handsome, I’m talented too."
707,I do think that ur going to become a celebrity or a movie star soon tho.
ZEN,It’s very nice of you to say that…
ZEN,but I don’t know if that’s what I really want.
ZEN,I feel good about just being a normal musical actor.
MC,I understand how you feel.
ZEN,You do?
ZEN,MC might have seen…
ZEN,someone around her change because of their environment….
ZEN,It’s a bit sad to witness something like that.
ZEN,People should never forget their original intentions.
707,Ya that’s true.
MC,Isn’t it better to succeed?
ZEN,That’s true…
ZEN,But they say people change
707,I doubt u’d change~
707,"U don’t show off, u have no other passion~"
707,Ur a total workaholic lololol
707,U are a bit narcissistic but still lolololol
ZEN,I hope so.
707,But still~
707,It feels good when more people recognize ur talent~
707,Surrounded by people The popularity!
707,Fame!
707,It’s a huge happiness to have ur name known.
707,Feeling satisfied in a small pond is ungrateful!
707,I helped u in the hopes u’d escape that small pond~! ++
ZEN,Alright…lol
ZEN,"If it weren’t for your help, I would never have gotten famous."
ZEN,"Also, if it weren’t for V’s help…"
ZEN,I would be living a different life right now.
MC,How did V help you?
ZEN,Oh. That story.
ZEN,He recognized my talent when I wasn’t really known.
ZEN,Well to be honest.. Rika recognized my talent and V was her boyfriend.
ZEN,V helped me a lot spiritually.
ZEN,I was thinking of quitting musicals at the time..
MC,How did 707 help you?
707,Ahem~!
ZEN,"I think he videotaped me singing,"
ZEN,"added a bunch of fancy special effects,"
ZEN,"uploaded it to Youtube,"
ZEN,and hacked something to spread the link like a virus.
707,U went super viral because it worked lolol
ZEN,I got a lot of haters then too;;
ZEN,Since it was practically a virus.
707,"But ultimately, everything worked out right? lolol"
ZEN,I still feel a bit iffy about that…
707,But didn’t u flat out reject Jumin’s help though? lolol
707,He brought a bunch of sponsors to host a huge event
707,and u just kicked it
707,all away~
ZEN,Yeah.
ZEN,I don’t really want his help. -_-
MC,Are you not in good terms with Jumin?
ZEN,No.
ZEN,I just don’t really like him.
ZEN,He tried to solve everything with money… he’s pretty arrogant too.
707,He just doesn’t like him.
ZEN,Ya.
MC,"Zen, you’re not jealous of Jumin, are you?"
707,Ya I think he’s jelly.
ZEN,No!
707,Then I guess Jumin’s not his taste.
ZEN,What do you mean taste;; We’re both guys.
707,Then give me a reason why u don’t like Jumin.
ZEN,I don’t need a reason.
ZEN,I just don’t.
707,lolololol makes no sense
ZEN,Whatever ;
707,!
707,I have to go work now.
ZEN,This late?
707,Ya
707,"Anyways, congrats on ur new role."
ZEN,Thanks. Hope work goes well. I have to go to bed now.
MC,"Good luck on your work, Seven."
707,thx ^^
MC,"Good night, Zen."
ZEN,"Good dreams, MC."
MC,"Yoosung, what are you doing at this hour?"
YOOSUNG,Oh… Hello MC…
MC,Hiya.
YOOSUNG,Hiya MC~
YOOSUNG,I… just looked at the clock and I’m shocked.
YOOSUNG,I can’t believe I gamed until this late.
YOOSUNG,T_T
MC,lolol It’s okay.
YOOSUNG,Do… do you think so?
YOOSUNG,I feel much better hearing u say that….
MC,Don’t play games too much.
YOOSUNG,Come to think of it… I have a test tomorrow.
YOOSUNG,I completely forgot about it…
YOOSUNG,I… ended up joining the LOLOL Association.
MC,How about inviting them to the RFA party?
YOOSUNG,Oh…?
YOOSUNG,I never thought about that.
YOOSUNG,"MC, u must be a genius…lolol"
YOOSUNG,I’ll message them right now.
YOOSUNG,What am I going to do…
YOOSUNG,I can’t stop playing LOLOL.
YOOSUNG,Why is LOLOL so fun?
YOOSUNG,Why the hell does it have to be so fun!?
MC,You just fell for the game company’s evil master plan.
YOOSUNG,I see…
YOOSUNG,Ur smart.
YOOSUNG,I’m just a mere creature that can’t escape from LOLOL.
MC,Since you are lonely.
YOOSUNG,Uh…
YOOSUNG,Dark circles… T_T
YOOSUNG,I should go sleep now.
MC,You raged too much… Good night~
YOOSUNG,Alright ^^
YOOSUNG,U should go to bed soon too.
MC,Good night.
YOOSUNG,You too~
JAEHEE,?
JAEHEE,Yoosung just left.
JAEHEE,Asking why the game is so fun…
JAEHEE,Of course it is due to the fact that he does not have a girlfriend.
JAEHEE,I hope you realize that the character in that image is not Yoosung.
JUMIN,Yes. That is true.
MC,"Jaehee, you logged in pretty late."
JAEHEE,I finished work and just came back home.
JAEHEE,"I guess you just got home as well, Mr. Han."
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,"Yes, since we’re talking about it.."
JUMIN,Assistant Kang.
JUMIN,If you are bored these days
JUMIN,how about dating Yoosung?
MC,That’s a bit too much…
JAEHEE,I guess MC is the only one who understands me.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han
JAEHEE,If I told you to
JAEHEE,go out with me if you are bored
JAEHEE,would you feel good about it?
JUMIN,Hmm…
JUMIN,I thought it was a good idea but I guess it isn’t.
JAEHEE,"Mr. Han, please do not make nonsensical comments. I have feelings."
JUMIN,You can have a long career if you repress such feelings.
JAEHEE,I am stopping myself because my salary is on the line.
MC,Capitalism is so sad…
JAEHEE,"I agree, MC."
MC,I think Jumin was just joking.
JAEHEE,I hope it is true.
JUMIN,"Yes, it was a joke."
JAEHEE,"Mr. Han, shouldn’t you go to bed early?"
JAEHEE,You’re planned to leave on a business trip at lunch.
JAEHEE,And you have a meeting in the morning with the Cultured Citizens Organization.
JUMIN,A day business trip abroad.
JUMIN,I can sleep in the plane.
JAEHEE,Then… can I call you right now concerning tomorrow’s meeting?
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,I’ll be up all night anyways.
MC,You seem very busy… Good luck!
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JUMIN,"Good night, MC."
JAEHEE,We’ll be going now.
MC,Ah… I’m starting to feel fuzzy.
ZEN,"You need more sleep, little lady."
ZEN,It’s bad for your skin if you don’t get enough rest.
MC,"Zen, good morning."
ZEN,"Good morning, MC."
ZEN,It’s early and you are online!
MC,I spent a restless night with thoughts of you.
MC,I usually wake up early
ZEN,That’s the opposite of me! Haha
ZEN,You must be a good girl.
ZEN,I am so curious about you.
ZEN,Btw
ZEN,Jumin…
ZEN,why is he trying to be a matchmaker for Yoosung and Jaehee?
ZEN,That guy has zero sensibility.
MC,You’re the best in that area.
ZEN,You are quite right.
ZEN,"I am a bit handsome, cool, and extremely sensible, but…"
ZEN,if you fall for me too much you’ll get in trouble… Wach out.
ZEN,lololol
MC,I think he’s too practical.
ZEN,True.
ZEN,I don’t know if it’s because of his job
ZEN,but the reason why Jaehee works like a robot
ZEN,is because Jumin is a robot.
JUMIN,You guys were dissing me.
ZEN,"Oh, Mr. Chairman,"
ZEN,How nice of you to grace us with your presence!
JUMIN,Stop faking respect.
ZEN,You caught me trashing you.
JUMIN,Don’t trash me next time.
JUMIN,Revenge.
ZEN,"Gahh, take that cat away!!"
ZEN,I feel like sneezing just by looking at the photo…!
JUMIN,Feel more pain meow
ZEN,Don’t meow!
ZEN,It doesn’t suit your face!
MC,How childish…
ZEN,Ya very childish…
ZEN,You weren’t that kind of a character.
ZEN,Return to your normal self.
MC,Is this gap moe;;;
JUMIN,Gap moe? What’s that.
ZEN,Gap + moe
ZEN,An attraction stemming from a character that shows two largely contrasting traits.
JUMIN,How do you know that term?
ZEN,That word… from the new work.
JUMIN,I assume it’s a compliment?
ZEN,Don’t really know about that…
JUMIN,Meow?
ZEN,You’ll never listen…
ZEN,I’m gonna go;;;
ZEN,I don’t want to spend another second with that jerk.
JUMIN,Hahaha
JUMIN,A second passed meow.
MC,I’m leaving too;;
ZEN,"If you are tired, try get some sleep, ok?"
MC,"Good bye, Zen."
ZEN,"MC, are you going to stay?"
ZEN,Nothing will come out of talking with that man.
JUMIN,I have to leave as well.
JUMIN,I’m late for meeting.
ZEN,At this hour?
JUMIN,Ya
ZEN,Then I’ll be going.
ZEN,Let’s talk longer later.
JUMIN,I’ll be going too.
MC,"Hello, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,MC.
JAEHEE,You’re here…
MC,"Jumin, I’ve been seeing you often today."
JUMIN,I guess so.
JUMIN,I had to come home to change several times today.
JUMIN,I can’t help but use my phone during the commute.
MC,Hey 707.
707,"Oh, MC."
707,Ur here ^^
JUMIN,Meeting’s over!
JAEHEE,I’m glad it went well.
JAEHEE,You must hurry since you have to go to the airport in the afternoon.
MC,What meeting was it?
JAEHEE,It was the morning meeting.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han has a hellish schedule.
707,Who did u meet with? Were they fun people?
MC,Airport?
JAEHEE,Yes… Mr. Han has to go to Hong Kong in the afternoon.
JAEHEE,He is planned to return in the evening.
JUMIN,I’ll probably spend more time in the plane.
JUMIN,But the meeting today was fairly interesting.
JAEHEE,That is a relief.
707,Who did you meet with?
JAEHEE,It was an organization called Cultured Citizens.
JUMIN,They are a bit political.
707,Oh ho~
707,It’s perfect for cultured Jumin.
JAEHEE,I am not so sure.
JAEHEE,They were all desperate to get in contact with him.
JAEHEE,The organization was largely composed of rich single women.
JUMIN,Whew. It was more exhausting than I expected.
JAEHEE,"But thanks to your sugar-coated smooth talk, we’ve received an enormous investment."
707,omg sugar-coated words.
JUMIN,I must sacrifice for the company.
707,What a powerful combination.
MC,"Seven, you didn’t go to work yet?"
707,Moi?
707,I’m waiting until my boss calls.
707,I don’t really have set work hours…
JAEHEE,That is similar to me.
707,If u don’t have set work hours
707,ur practically the company’s slave and not an employee.
JAEHEE,I agree.
MC,What kind of sugar-coated words?
JAEHEE,Compliments.
JAEHEE,Compliments not related to money.
JAEHEE,"Their grace and personality, the color of their scarves, earrings, kind-looking appearances…"
JAEHEE,Things like that.
JAEHEE,"Right about the time hearts were about to pop out of their eyes,"
JAEHEE,we put forward a contract filled with numbers.
707,omg
707,Will they sign?
JAEHEE,The probability is approximately 98%
MC,I guess Jumin is popular?
JUMIN,"They like my money, not me."
JAEHEE,I don’t think that’s really the case…
JUMIN,I have seen a countless number of my father’s girlfriends.
JUMIN,I know what they want.
707,"Since we’re talking about it, u guys should ask that cultured something organization to come to the party."
JAEHEE,You mean the Cultured Citizens Organization?
JAEHEE,I do not really like those women
JAEHEE,but that is a good idea.
JAEHEE,"How do you think, MC?"
MC,I think it’ll be good.
JUMIN,Get me in touch with the organization right now.
JAEHEE,Alright.
MC,I don’t think it’s a good idea.
707,"Hmm~ If MC thinks so, we have no choice."
JUMIN,"Seven, if someone comes into your mind, invite them as well."
707,Uhm… I like fun people coming to the party lol
707,I
707,Oh yeah!
707,U know I read a lot of fantasy novels?
707,The movie called Lady of the Bracelets is a masterpiece
707,and I heard that the Lady really exists.
JUMIN,!?
JAEHEE,What is that nonsense;
JAEHEE,Who is this lady you’re talking about from the movie?
MC,That small creature?
707,Yeah… I want to see more of that animal lol
JUMIN,You’re changing your words.
707,Noooo
707,I know that animal is not real lol
707,I’m not that stupid!
JAEHEE,That’s a relief.
JAEHEE,I guess that 707 has some normalcy.
MC,The main character?
JAEHEE,I assume so.
JAEHEE,I can’t believe that person really exists… Although I do not really want to meet her;
707,"Jaehee, u saw that movie too~ lol"
JAEHEE,;;;
707,lolol Can’t u try looking for her?
707,With Jumin’s resources.
JUMIN,"Lady of the bracelets,"
JUMIN,There’s still woman in this day and age who calls herself the Lady?
MC,Omg.
JAEHEE,I’m quite flustered as well.
JAEHEE,We cannot use Mr. Han’s authority for something as nonsensical as this.
MC,lololol
JAEHEE,It is not something to laugh about.
JAEHEE,Actually.
JAEHEE,Just laugh about it.
707,"lolol Anyways, I really want to meet the Lady of the Bracelets."
JAEHEE,People of your dreams are best in your dreams.
JAEHEE,Leave it that way.
707,I should tell Yoosung too.
707,We went to see the movie Lady of the Bracelets together lolol
MC,I think it’s a story Yoosung would love lolol
707,Oh?
707,"MC, u already know his taste."
MC,I don’t think that person exists;;
JAEHEE,I agree.
JAEHEE,;; This is very useless.
JAEHEE,Let’s forget our discussion here and now.
JUMIN,Elizabeth the 3rd could never get her eyes off the TV when the Lady of the Bracelets series came on.
JAEHEE,"Do everything you can to find her, Assistant Kang."
JAEHEE,I’m sorry?
JAEHEE,What did you say?
JUMIN,Why. It’ll be fun.
707,"lolololol Yeah, find her! lolol"
MC,Look for her lololol
707,lololol Yeah!
MC,Omg…
JAEHEE,I am so amazed I do not know what to do with myself.
MC,Everything is for elise!
JUMIN,That is a good attitude.
707,Tell me if you find something!
707,I just got work. Disappearing now!
JAEHEE,Do you really want me to search for her?
JUMIN,Ya
JAEHEE,For real?
JUMIN,Yeah. I have to go take the plane.
JAEHEE,Ahhh… T_T
MC,You might find her once you start looking!
JAEHEE,I doubt… I will be able to.
JAEHEE,I will start the search for now but…
MC,Jaehee… Good luck.
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,I am not inclined… but I will have to do the search.
JAEHEE,My head hurts…
JAEHEE,I’ll have to go inquire about that ‘Lady of the Bracelets’.
MC,Good luck!
JAEHEE,…Thank you.
MC,I have to go now.
JAEHEE,Good bye.
MC,Hiya
ZEN,lol Hey.
MC,"Zen, you’re here."
ZEN,"MC, you’re logged in."
ZEN,Seven’s so funny lolol
ZEN,A movie should stay a movie~
ZEN,Haha
ZEN,When that movie came out Yoosung and Seven were pretty crazy about it.
ZEN,They didn’t go to the bathroom for more than three hours in order to watch the movie.
ZEN,I never thought the craze would last this long… haha.
ZEN,A lady of the bracelets doesn’t exist in reality haha
ZEN,"If he means the master of beauty, then that person is here."
MC,Add one more crazy patient~.
MC,"Master, you are here."
ZEN,"Hearing you acknowledge it,"
ZEN,why do I feel so happy?
ZEN,Ahh… I feel so happy.
ZEN,Thank you
ZEN,"To be honest, every time I look into the mirror, I feel amazed."
ZEN,…Who the hell is so good looking?
ZEN,Oh!
ZEN,Me…
ZEN,No unauthorized distribution lolol
MC,I won’t.
ZEN,You can spread it. Just name the source.
MC,Then I will~.
ZEN,^^
ZEN,So cute.
MC,Handsome~
ZEN,"Yes, that’s it!"
ZEN,Ah…
ZEN,I feel like I’ve been reborn in front of you.
ZEN,I should go take a shower to appreciate my looks for while.
MC,Oh no~.
ZEN,Don’t be shy…lol
ZEN,"You’re so cute, MC."
ZEN,Then I’ll get going.
MC,See you later.
ZEN,Okay. See you~.
MC,"Oh, Jaehee you just came in."
JAEHEE,Yes…
MC,"Jaehee, good to see you~. Zen was just here."
JAEHEE,Oh… I see!
JAEHEE,Zen’s… beautiful figure.
JAEHEE,It is a good photo.
JAEHEE,It is a very good photo!
MC,"Yoosung, I missed you~!"
YOOSUNG,"Hey, I’m here~ lolol"
MC,More people are coming in.
YOOSUNG,Oh? Jaehee’s here too.
YOOSUNG,But…
YOOSUNG,Zen…lolol
YOOSUNG,Such a narcissist.
YOOSUNG,I can’t bare to look at it…
YOOSUNG,Why did he leave his photo? lolol
JAEHEE,Not everyone can act with their eyes like that.
JAEHEE,There is enough artistic value to preserve it.
YOOSUNG,Artistic value…
YOOSUNG,"These have artistic value, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,-_-
YOOSUNG,Do you know how hard I worked for five days to get that armor?
JAEHEE,Do not compare an artificial photo like that with natural art.
YOOSUNG,"MC, which has more artistic value to you?"
MC,The photo of Zen.
JAEHEE,Quite right you are.
JAEHEE,What woman would resist that photo?
MC,The LOLOL avatar.
YOOSUNG,lolol See. MC gets me.
YOOSUNG,^^
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,I suddenly… feel an urge.
JAEHEE,Even though I’m in the office… I want to watch Zen’s musical on DVD for a moment.
MC,You have a DVD?
JAEHEE,Of course.
MC,I want to see it too..
JAEHEE,"If I get the chance, I will definitely lend it to you!"
JAEHEE,"If it is too much of a bother, you can simply purchase it online."
JAEHEE,It is a huge source of motivation.
JAEHEE,Seriously.
YOOSUNG,omg
YOOSUNG,Jaehee’s not joking…
JAEHEE,I must go.
YOOSUNG,lolol Good bye.
YOOSUNG,"It’s just us two now, MC. ^^"
MC,Yeah….
YOOSUNG,Before you came
YOOSUNG,there were times when no one talked for days.
YOOSUNG,"It’s all because of you, MC haha"
YOOSUNG,"Thank you,"
YOOSUNG,for staying in the organization ^^
MC,It’s nothing. I’m only doing what I can.
YOOSUNG,I feel warm and fuzzy.
YOOSUNG,It’d be great to keep talking to you like this…^^
MC,"Thank you for being so kind to me, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,"MC, why do you only say things I want to hear."
YOOSUNG,You’re totally…
YOOSUNG,my type?!
YOOSUNG,^^
MC,Aren’t you going to go game now?
YOOSUNG,I will soon haha
YOOSUNG,When will V tell us the party schedule?
YOOSUNG,I don’t like it that he decides everything by himself.
YOOSUNG,I hope he lets us…
YOOSUNG,go see you one day too.
MC,I want to meet you and everyone else too.
YOOSUNG,We’ll at least get to see each other at the party.
YOOSUNG,"You can’t come to a party through a messenger, right? lolol"
MC,I guess V has his own ideas about the party.
YOOSUNG,Right…?
YOOSUNG,Oh.
YOOSUNG,The guild members are telling me to come;
MC,"Okay, enjoy the game and let’s talk later ^^"
YOOSUNG,Thank you for being understanding.
YOOSUNG,^^
MC,Good bye.
YOOSUNG,"Bye, see you."
YOOSUNG,Then!
MC,"Jaehee, you’re online again?"
JAEHEE,Yes… I had something to do.
JAEHEE,I came to save the photo from past chat sessions.
MC,The photo of Zen?
JAEHEE,I knew you had an appreciative eye.
MC,You mean Yoosung’s game avatar?
MC,Do you think Zen looks handsome in the photo?
JAEHEE,Aren’t peppers red?
JAEHEE,Isn’t the sky blue?
JAEHEE,Isn’t water clear?
JAEHEE,Isn’t Zen handsome?
JAEHEE,They are all questions with the same answer.
JAEHEE,He said no unauthorized distribution..
JAEHEE,but I must save the photo.
JAEHEE,Just for myself.
YOOSUNG,"Jaehee, you want to take the photo of my avatar?"
MC,"Yoosung, good to see you ^^"
YOOSUNG,"Hey, MC~!"
YOOSUNG,I just finished a round haha
YOOSUNG,Gamers need breaks too!
JAEHEE,I have so much work to do… I am jealous.
MC,There’s no way Jaehee’s going to take a photo of your avatar.
JAEHEE,"It may be sad, but MC is correct."
JAEHEE,I was only trying to save the photo of Zen.
MC,"Jaehee, you must really like Zen~ lolol"
YOOSUNG,I agree!
JAEHEE,Oh…
JAEHEE,That… cannot be proven.
JAEHEE,There is no proof that I like Zen…
MC,I feel like you have feelings for him…
YOOSUNG,I think so too!
JAEHEE,I have never considered him that way…
JAEHEE,but I do not know my own feelings.
YOOSUNG,"If you don’t know, think about it more seriously lolol"
YOOSUNG,Maybe?!
JAEHEE,Let’s stop talking about this subject.
JAEHEE,I am a bit embarrassed.
JAEHEE,But aside from that…
JAEHEE,I found the Lady of the Bracelets that Luciel talked about.
MC,You like Zen’s musicals and photos of him.
YOOSUNG,Yeah
YOOSUNG,I feel like u like him more than as a fan.
JAEHEE,That’s because…
JAEHEE,When I look at an extraordinary piece of art
JAEHEE,I want to worship it and keep it for myself.
JAEHEE,I feel that way about Zen.
JAEHEE,Please do not take it the wrong way.
YOOSUNG,Hmm~
JAEHEE,But aside from that…
JAEHEE,I found the Lady of the Bracelets that Luciel talked about.
MC,Did you look into the Lady of the Bracelets?
JAEHEE,Oh… About that.
JAEHEE,I was forced to look into it due to Mr. Han’s orders but…
JAEHEE,She really does exist.
YOOSUNG,What!?
YOOSUNG,For real?!
YOOSUNG,The main character from the movie?!
JAEHEE,That would have been nice…
JAEHEE,but unfortunately it’s someone else.
YOOSUNG,Whuut
JAEHEE,It’s someone who became a millionaire with her bracelet business.
MC,Why don’t you invite her to the party?
JAEHEE,That’s a good idea.
JAEHEE,I will try contacting her right away.
MC,lololol That’s funny.
JAEHEE,I found it funny as well so I did not believe it…
JAEHEE,but unexpectedly she turned out to be a lonely person.
YOOSUNG,Lonely lololol
JAEHEE,"When Mr. Han comes back, I should introduce her."
YOOSUNG,omg…
JAEHEE,If we sign a contract with the bracelet business…
JAEHEE,We might be able to recover a bit of the loss from Mr. Han’s cat business.
JAEHEE,Luciel is sometimes helpful.
MC,I really can’t get used to that name. ‘Luciel’
YOOSUNG,I know…
YOOSUNG,Why do I cringe
YOOSUNG,hearing you say Luciel?
JAEHEE,It’s his real name. What can I do?
YOOSUNG,lololol
MC,Luciel… 707 must be an angel.
JAEHEE,I doubt…
JAEHEE,that…
YOOSUNG,Seven an angel lolololol
YOOSUNG,lolololol
YOOSUNG,But I do admit that Seven’s real name is awkward.
JAEHEE,"Yoosung, you are not the only one who thinks that way."
JAEHEE,I would like to call him by a normal name but
JAEHEE,"707,"
JAEHEE,"seven zero seven,"
JAEHEE,"seven,"
JAEHEE,"cat abuser,"
JAEHEE,and… Luciel…
JAEHEE,I do not think any of his names are normal.
YOOSUNG,Compared to that…
YOOSUNG,people do tell me that
YOOSUNG,I have a pretty name.
MC,I think Jaehee is a pretty name.
JAEHEE,I consider it quite plain
JAEHEE,but thank you for saying that.
YOOSUNG,"Yeah, I like your name, Jaehee lolol"
MC,Yoosung is a really pretty name.
YOOSUNG,lolol Right?
YOOSUNG,I’ve been invited to join clubs because of my name.
JAEHEE,That’s a surprise.
YOOSUNG,I have a story about my name..
YOOSUNG,A club studying meteors tried to recruit me.
YOOSUNG,because they studied a meteor called Yoosung!
JAEHEE,I see.
JAEHEE,This talk is really not helping.
MC,lolol….
YOOSUNG,Ahh… Sorry.
YOOSUNG,That sounded pretty lame right?
YOOSUNG,A club recruiting Yoosung
YOOSUNG,because it studies Yoosung…
JAEHEE,That’s enough. I think you can stop.
MC,Wow! I’m really curious about that club.
YOOSUNG,Really?
YOOSUNG,"To be honest, one of the senior students in that club"
YOOSUNG,wrote a paper on that meteorite last year
YOOSUNG,and apparently it was a sensation in the astronomy field and became famous!
JAEHEE,That is surprising coming from a club that recruits its members because of a name.
YOOSUNG,So the whole club became famous. But they were already famous because of their weird recruitment standards.
YOOSUNG,They recruited someone from another school just because he was famous in the astronomy field lolol
JAEHEE,And they tried to recruit you because the meteorite’s name is Yoosung?
YOOSUNG,Yeah lolol
MC,We should invite that club to our party!
YOOSUNG,That’s a good idea!
JAEHEE,Hmm.
YOOSUNG,I’ll contact them right now haha
YOOSUNG,I still have the president’s phone number.
MC,Interesting.
YOOSUNG,Right?
YOOSUNG,Thank you for thinking so!
YOOSUNG,I should go now.
YOOSUNG,I smashed a bunch of dragons with my team earlier…
YOOSUNG,I’m so tired.
MC,Did you level up?
YOOSUNG,A lot of levels…lolol
YOOSUNG,Ha… It was fun.
YOOSUNG,"I wish you could play LOLOL with me, MC."
MC,Take care of yourself…
JAEHEE,I agree. How about shortening the play time?
YOOSUNG,T_T….
JAEHEE,We are both only worrying for you.
JAEHEE,It is foolish to harm your body by playing games.
YOOSUNG,Alright…
YOOSUNG,I should take off my hoodie and take a hot shower.
MC,Hot shower +_+
YOOSUNG,Hahaha
YOOSUNG,It’s easier to fall asleep when I shower with hot water.
MC,"What are you going to do, Jaehee?"
JAEHEE,I must take care of the next agenda in the itinerary.
JAEHEE,"I’m the company’s slave, working 24/7."
JAEHEE,Mr. Han will arrive soon so I must get ready.
MC,Jaehee…. Good luck. I’m cheering for you!
JAEHEE,Cheering for…
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,"I will cheer for you too, MC. ^^"
YOOSUNG,Good bye…!
MC,"Yoosung, rest well!"
YOOSUNG,Ya.
YOOSUNG,"Thanks, MC."
JAEHEE,I’ll get going.
MC,"Zen, hello."
ZEN,Hey lol
ZEN,Ha. So refreshing.
MC,I want to see you take a shower…
ZEN,That’s a pretty strange way of greeting me…
ZEN,But I did take a shower just now.
ZEN,My hair is still wet.
ZEN,I hope Yoosung at least knows whether it’s day or night while playing games;;
ZEN,Or he could just stop playing games and go on dates…
MC,I want to go out with Yoosung…
ZEN,What?
ZEN,Hmm~.
ZEN,"You like innocent boys, I see."
MC,"I hope he becomes more like you, Zen."
ZEN,"You are very right, MC."
ZEN,"If he could have half the diligence and sexiness that I have,"
ZEN,he’d get a girlfriend before he knew it.
ZEN,A model agency is coming to see me tomorrow.
ZEN,I have no idea why they’d want to see me though.
MC,Maybe they want you to model for them since you’re handsome?
ZEN,lolol
ZEN,"I don’t want to be arrogant, but that did cross my mind."
MC,I think you’ll be more profitable as a model than as an actor.
ZEN,Hmm…
ZEN,I actually really like acting.
ZEN,Didn’t think you’d say something like that.
ZEN,It’s a bit sad.
ZEN,"Anyways, the agency is pretty big."
ZEN,I have to prepare myself.
JAEHEE,I agree with your advice on Yoosung.
MC,"Hello, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Hello.
MC,I agree too…
JAEHEE,Right?
JAEHEE,Stop playing games and go on dates.
JAEHEE,Although I am not quite sure if Yoosung would be able to do that.
JAEHEE,If he wants to stop being single
JAEHEE,I’d like to tell him to use his energy for something other than games.
ZEN,Hmm… Playing games is a hobby
ZEN,so I support doing it moderately
ZEN,but I think Yoosung is too addicted to it.
ZEN,What if he loses his chance to go on dates being busy with games lolol
MC,"If Yoosung gets a girlfriend, he might stop playing games."
ZEN,Will he?…
JAEHEE,lol
JAEHEE,He has changed clubs ten times in the past year but he has never changed his games.
ZEN,Is LoLoL really that fun?
JAEHEE,I’m afraid it is.
JAEHEE,The game is so popular that there is an international competition every year.
MC,"You know everything, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,"Well, this is just basic knowledge."
ZEN,Jaehee has encyclopedic knowledge haha.
JAEHEE,I don’t know about encyclopedic…
ZEN,Gahh… I want to go on dates.
ZEN,But I can’t.
MC,"Do you like games, Jaehee?"
JAEHEE,"If you’ve seen my message records, you’d know that I do not like games."
ZEN,I can’t even imagine Jaehee playing games.
JAEHEE,Neither can I.
ZEN,Gahh… I want to go on dates.
ZEN,But I can’t.
MC,"I guess you focus more on women than hobbies, Zen."
ZEN,Thanks for saying that lolol
ZEN,I’ve been too busy the past few years
ZEN,"but before when I dated someone, I never looked anywhere else."
ZEN,"If I get into one thing, it takes over my life."
JAEHEE,…Is that so?
ZEN,Yes. It’s quite natural when you’re seeing someone.
JAEHEE,You must be cautious of getting into scandals since you’re a famous actor.
ZEN,I’m not that famous. lolol
ZEN,I’m just too busy right now so I don’t think I can make my girlfriend happy.
MC,You’re not ready to be in love.
JAEHEE,It is not easy to be ready to be in love.
JAEHEE,I think it would be better for Zen to focus more on work.
ZEN,You both think that I’m not ready to love?
ZEN,…That’s not completely wrong.
MC,What’s wrong with being busy? Love is more imporatant.
ZEN,…Wow.
ZEN,Do you really think so?
ZEN,I like you MC.
JAEHEE,I don’t know. 
JAEHEE,I do not think it’s very realistic. 
JAEHEE,If Zen had a girlfriend…
JAEHEE,It would be troublesome since there are a lot of female fans who like Zen.
ZEN,Hmm… That is true.
ZEN,But if I had to choose between
ZEN,popularity and my girlfriend…
ZEN,I’d choose my girlfriend.
MC,Oh… So romantic!!
ZEN,lololol Right?
ZEN,My heart beats fast just thinking about it.
JAEHEE,I think it is a foolish choice.
MC,You’d lose your popularity though.
JAEHEE,I agree.
JAEHEE,You must be careful Zen.
JAEHEE,…You must not be distracted and follow your path.
JAEHEE,Relationships are temporary fantasies fabricated by emotions.
JAEHEE,Do not waste your talent because of idiotic fantasies!
ZEN,Hmm…
ZEN,Seeing you say that.
ZEN,I think maybe…
ZEN,"you have never been in love, Jaehee."
MC,Jaehee has a point. lol
JAEHEE,Thank you for understanding.
JAEHEE,"My only hope is that you succed, Zen."
JAEHEE,It is difficult to recover a tarnished reputation.
ZEN,Recover…
ZEN,"The more popular I get, the more I fee like I’m walking on a tightrope."
MC,I want to fall in love…
ZEN,Me too.
ZEN,I think it’d be better if the person is positive.
JAEHEE,….
JAEHEE,And about me never having been in love…
ZEN,Wait…
ZEN,The director says he’s right in front of my house;;
ZEN,I’ll be out for a sec!
MC,"Jaehee, what did you say about being in love?"
MC,Logged out as fast as lightning…
JAEHEE,"I do not really understand what made you say that, but as someone who’s had a considerable amount of life experiences, I cannot say that I have never been in a relationship and I am not an innocent girl who has no experience whatsoever."
JAEHEE,…He left while I was typing.
MC,I guess you’re not an innocent girl lolol
JAEHEE,….
JAEHEE,;;;;;
MC,lololol That’s a long sentence.
JAEHEE,Oh…
JAEHEE,It’s embarrassing.
MC,lololol
JAEHEE,Do not laugh -_-
MC,It’s fine~
JAEHEE,It’s not fine but…
JAEHEE,I’m less embarrassed since you are here.
JAEHEE,This chatting room doesn’t allow you to delete sent messages.
JAEHEE,Why not!?
JAEHEE,This messenger is difficult to use…
JAEHEE,"Please add the feature mentioned above, 707."
MC,Will he add it though. lolol
JAEHEE,….
JAEHEE,I am not sure.
MC,It’s fine. You didn’t say anything weird~.
JAEHEE,I hope it wasn’t.
JAEHEE,I’ll leave right now since I’m embarrassed.
MC,"Yoosung, hello."
YOOSUNG,MC ^^ I’m back.
MC,Did you finish your shower? lol
YOOSUNG,Yeah. Some time ago.
YOOSUNG,It was really refreshing.
YOOSUNG,Feels like my skin is a bit lighter?
YOOSUNG,Jaehee’s too harsh.
YOOSUNG,What does she mean I won’t get a girlfriend if I play games T_T
YOOSUNG,"If I don’t play LoLoL, I get so lonely that it becomes difficult to handle."
MC,I’ll make sure you’re not lonely.
YOOSUNG,What?!
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,"To be honest, I think I feel less lonely these days because of u~!"
YOOSUNG,"Even while I play games, I keep checking"
YOOSUNG,whether or not ur online.
MC,You won’t get lonely if you play in teams~.
YOOSUNG,That’s true.
YOOSUNG,And it’s even more fun if you voice chat lololol
MC,What did you do during the day?
YOOSUNG,I played games during the day lol
MC,Do you have any hobbies other than games?
YOOSUNG,I do! But they always change.
YOOSUNG,My hobbies are usually my club activities.
YOOSUNG,For example… when I was in the fencing club my hobby was fencing…
YOOSUNG,"when I was in the running club, it was running…"
YOOSUNG,"when I was in the English newspaper club, my hobby was reading English newspaper… or not."
YOOSUNG,…I quit that club pretty early.
YOOSUNG,Oh! I didn’t have class today but I went to school anyways.
YOOSUNG,And I made coffee in the barista club lolol
YOOSUNG,The coffee I dripped heehee…
YOOSUNG,My friends kept on telling me to join the barista club so I went to check it out.
YOOSUNG,It was so fun…
YOOSUNG,Should I learn how to make coffee?
MC,I think it suits you.
YOOSUNG,Does it?!
YOOSUNG,Haha… Maybe I should take it seriously…
YOOSUNG,my friend contacted me to log into LoLoL…
YOOSUNG,I’ll be off!
ZEN,No you won’t;
YOOSUNG,Ya? I’m already on.
ZEN,"Fast, that guy."
MC,"Hello, lovely Zen."
ZEN,Hey cute lady. How are you?
MC,Hello Zen.
ZEN,"Hello, MC."
ZEN,"Yoosung, is playing games all you do at home?"
ZEN,Do you even study?
YOOSUNG,I do stdby.
ZEN,Where
YOOSUNG,linyrary
ZEN,What’s that?
YOOSUNG,library
ZEN,Stop playing games and come here.
YOOSUNG,Wait a saqc
MC,lolol you have so many typos.
YOOSUNG,lolol
ZEN,;;;
ZEN,"It’s not funny, he’s just careless -_-"
MC,"Zen, you have something you want to say?"
ZEN,How did you know?
ZEN,"I don’t think that guy’s going to listen, so I’ll just tell you."
MC,Go ahead.
ZEN,Listen to this. lol
ZEN,The romance novel writers came today with the director to see me.
ZEN,Since this new piece is based on a romance novel…
ZEN,"Apparently, that writer is pretty respected in that group."
ZEN,It did get a bit tiring…
ZEN,She kept saying that she has connections with a group of female artists.
ZEN,and that she’d introduce me to them next time…
ZEN,It was a bit too much.
MC,It must have been hard for you…
ZEN,T_T
ZEN,Oh well. It’s only a penalty for my good looks.
YOOSUNG,lol
ZEN,^^
MC,Invite that group to the party!
ZEN,Should…I?
YOOSUNG,gied idae
ZEN,Ya
ZEN,Not my type…
ZEN,but if we invite them to the party
ZEN,I think Jaehee will like it.
ZEN,I’ll talk to them about it.
ZEN,"Fyi, this is the photo of my character."
ZEN,We already did the photo shoot.
YOOSUNG,sexy
ZEN,Right? lolol
YOOSUNG,ya
ZEN,Don’t give me that causal response! Respond more passionately!
MC,Looks okay lol
YOOSUNG,lolol
ZEN,Okay…
ZEN,I wanted a more passionate response…
ZEN,Is there something wrong with the way I posed…?
MC,You look better than a model!
ZEN,lolol I know right!?
MC,You should be a movie star!!
ZEN,Hmm~ Rather than saying I look like a movie star…
ZEN,I hope you pay more attention to the character.
MC,Why do you have to be so selfish and look so handsome?
ZEN,lolololol
ZEN,I don’t know.
ZEN,I think god made a mistake
YOOSUNG,.
YOOSUNG,-_-
YOOSUNG,i’m going now bye bye
ZEN,I have to leave too.
ZEN,I bragged enough for today.
ZEN,I should go practice my lines.
MC,"Zen, good bye^^"
ZEN,"Okay, thanks for hearing me out."
MC,"Yoosung, have fun with your game~ lolol"
YOOSUNG,Okay ^^
YOOSUNG,Sorry for sending
YOOSUNG,short messages bc of the game
ZEN,At least you have a conscience.
YOOSUNG,Then bye.
ZEN,Bye~
707,Yo…
707,Is anyone here?
MC,I’m here ^^
707,Yay! It’s you.
JAEHEE,I am also here.
707,"You both, plz listen to me."
MC,"Jaehee, you’re here."
JAEHEE,Hello.
707,"MC, you were here too."
JAEHEE,"I haven’t seen you all day, Seven."
707,I was trapped inside all day and had to work T_T
MC,Serves you right.
707,Wow
707,I must have done something wrong to MC.
JAEHEE,You must have. Think carefully.
JAEHEE,You must have done something wrong to everyone.
JAEHEE,"For example, violating their privacy."
707,T_T
MC,For what?
707,It’s difficult to say…
JAEHEE,I feel like it’s better not to know.
707,Ya. Ur right.
707,"The day I reveal top secret information, I might be gone from this world before I know it."
707,It’s a place I’m working part time as a freelancer
707,and they just lock people in for security reasons…
707,"So if I reveal classified information, they’ll probably torture me in the basement…"
707,omg
707,T_T…
707,Ya…
707,I’m a dangerous person so be careful lolol
JAEHEE,Do not do anything dangerous.
MC,"Watch out for yourself, 707."
707,Yeah… Thank you.
707,It’s been a while since I’ve heard something like that.
707,Someone’s worrying for me. So touching!
JAEHEE,Since your pranks are a bit too much
JAEHEE,and you have slow wits at times
JAEHEE,not everyone expresses their worry for you..
JAEHEE,Since you seem like a person who takes cares of dangerous things without a problem.
MC,"The more positive a person is, the more sensitive they are."
707,Oh!
707,Is that so!?
707,I am a sensitive person… A creature with a clear innocent heart like a gentle lamb.
JAEHEE,I cannot help but sigh.
MC,"To be honest, you do seem that way."
JAEHEE,If you could be honest and show your vulnerability at times
JAEHEE,I think you might seem more like a human.
707,I am showing my vulnerability right now.
707,Save me T_T
MC,"I’ll be careful of Seven, Jaehee ^^"
JAEHEE,Yes.
JAEHEE,"To be honest, he is the most suspicious member."
707,What did I ever do T_T
JAEHEE,He has the power to control this chatroom however as he pleases.
707,I can’t do anything without V’s permission~.
JAEHEE,We have to thank the fact that 707 has a very positive personality.
JAEHEE,"If he were a villain, he could use his powers for terrible things."
707,I’m a nice person. Don’t say that lolol
707,We can just be friends ^^
JAEHEE,…That is quite hard.
JAEHEE,"Anyways,"
JAEHEE,are you not going to add the message deleting feature?
JAEHEE,I made the request a bit earlier.
707,Ya?
707,Oh…
707,"” I do not really understand what made you say that, but as someone who’s had a considerable amount of life experiences, I cannot say that I have never been in a relationship and I am not an innocent girl who has no experience whatsoever”"
707,You mean this?
JAEHEE,OMG
707,The members already read it. Probably except V.
707,The not-so-innocent Jaehee who knows her men.
707,You can’t take back what’s happened in the past! Unless you have a time machine!
JAEHEE,Can’t you be more serious about this?
707,Hmm…
707,Jaehee.
707,"You like Zen, right?"
JAEHEE,"It’s not that I do not like him, but do not take it the wrong way."
707,Then it’s best not to say anything vague like that.
707,Liking someone is selfish.
707,It clouds your mind and makes you do and say things you normally wouldn’t.
707,"But the better you control that, the more control you have over relationships."
707,You can prevent any potential problems and have the upper hand in the relationship.
707,Although loneliness will follow you always (u x YOU o )
JAEHEE,…???
MC,"Have you lived your life this way, Seven?"
707,lololol I don’t know.
707,I don’t really understand what this means.
707,It says so…
MC,It’s not like you to be so serious…
707,…in the book called ‘Expert Playboy’.
707,lololol
MC,lololololololol
707,lololololololol
JAEHEE,Why are you reading a book like that?
707,Only because I like to read a variety of books.
MC,Don’t tease Jaehee~!
JAEHEE,Really please.
JAEHEE,;;;
JAEHEE,Thank you for the advice from the book.
JAEHEE,I must read it.
707,Read it and become a playboy yo.
JAEHEE,I am not interested in such a thing.
JAEHEE,"Anyways, I’ll be off for a moment."
707,I’m going to get some sleep too… >_<
707,My eyes keep closing.
MC,"Jaehee, let’s talk soon~"
JAEHEE,Okay. Good bye.
MC,"Sleep tight, 707."
707,Yeah. Goodbye.
MC,"Hiya, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Hello.
YOOSUNG,Hiya.
MC,"Hey, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,gd
YOOSUNG,hi
YOOSUNG,hiiii hiiii
YOOSUNG,Why do I like using childish greetings?
JAEHEE,You must not want to get old.
YOOSUNG,Still the youngest in the group.
JAEHEE,Getting old is what’s sad. Please do not say that to me.
YOOSUNG,But you know…
YOOSUNG,Seven…
YOOSUNG,Can’t believe he was locked in for work.
YOOSUNG,No wonder he didn’t show up all day yesterday.
JAEHEE,I’m worried he might be involved in something dangerous.
MC,I’m worried about Seven.
JAEHEE,I agree.
MC,"Hello, Zen~"
ZEN,"Hey, MC~"
JAEHEE,"Hello, Zen."
ZEN,Hey Jaehee
YOOSUNG,What would it feel like to be locked in?
ZEN,???
MC,Wouldn’t it feel as if you’re under someone’s control?
ZEN,Hey. What’s up with you?
ZEN,Are you sick or something?
YOOSUNG,I want someone to control me T_T
ZEN,What is he saying
YOOSUNG,I can’t control LoLoL…
MC,I can lock you up lol
YOOSUNG,lolololololol So exciting.
YOOSUNG,Just lock me in with a computer.
ZEN,Then that won’t mean anything -_-
ZEN,Try that game.
ZEN,The one where a cat locks you in if you do something wrong.
ZEN,What was the name? Was it Tenderlion or Dandelion by Jelitz?
JAEHEE,Oh… That game.
JAEHEE,It’s a PC game that’s being sold at Steam. +++
JAEHEE,Dandelion
ZEN,Why is that name so hard;;;
ZEN,A fan told me to try it.
YOOSUNG,I know what that is. I saw it online.
YOOSUNG,I’m a guy so I don’t play games like that.
MC,Try taking on another hobby ^^
ZEN,I agree.
ZEN,Why don’t you at least try playing another game?
YOOSUNG,I can’t betray LoLoL and play something else.
MC,Your productivity would probably increase.
ZEN,Can’t believe you’d say that.
YOOSUNG,omg so scary
JAEHEE,I agree to a certain degree.
ZEN,Women are more scary for sure.
YOOSUNG,Actually lolol
YOOSUNG,I just wanted to know what it’d feel like when the ever-so-smart Seven can’t do what he wants lol
ZEN,You lock yourself in your room everyday because of LoLoL.
YOOSUNG,But that’s my choice~
JAEHEE,So you do not deny it.
MC,"Zen, have you ever acted out a situation where you’re locked up?"
ZEN,Hmm…
ZEN,Good question.
MC,Let’s talk about something more appropriate.
JAEHEE,I agree.
JAEHEE,I’d prefer if we talk about a more proper subject.
YOOSUNG,Jaehee’s pretty conservative for sure lolol
YOOSUNG,Have you acted out something like that?
ZEN,When I was in musicals…
ZEN,acting a character who’s locked up…
ZEN,I guess that has happened a few times.
ZEN,But.
ZEN,But why do they always have to rip off my shirt ;;
ZEN,This picture is everywhere online.
JAEHEE,We should stop this improper conversation.
ZEN,What was the title of that musical…?
JAEHEE,“Promiscuous Jalapeno Topping”
YOOSUNG,Jaehee;;; You said we should be proper.
MC,lolololololol What is that? lololol
ZEN,lolololololol Funny right? I laughed too.
ZEN,"I read the script thinking maybe it’s rated r, but it wasn’t even that bad."
ZEN,Only the poster’s promiscuous.
JAEHEE,Classic marketing scheme.
MC,I wanna eat jalapeno cheese burger pizza.
YOOSUNG,Me too lolol
JAEHEE,Do not change the subject. And please stop talking about Pepper John’s Pizza.
YOOSUNG,The jalapeno cheese burger is from Paparazzi Pizza -_-
YOOSUNG,I can’t get a discount with Pepper John’s Pizza.
JAEHEE,Anyways…
JAEHEE,Everyone said that the original writer was high on drugs when writing it.
ZEN,Oh; Really?
ZEN,Ah! I remember.
MC,Jaehee! You have a really good memory.
JAEHEE,^^
JAEHEE,This is nothing as a fan.
MC,lolololololol I want to see that play.
ZEN,lololol Yeah.
ZEN,I am shirtless in like one scene in the middle.
ZEN,The fierce fight between the Jalapenos and the Pickles… was the topic.
ZEN,"“Jalapeno, weren’t you one of Pickle’s veggies…?!”"
ZEN,It was a strange script;
YOOSUNG,lolololololol
YOOSUNG,I want pizza.
MC,Me too…
YOOSUNG,A bunch of hot sauce and parmesan cheese on top…
YOOSUNG,That’s the staircase to heaven right there.
YOOSUNG,"Hey, wanna go with me?"
MC,Let’s build up the transfer together everyone.
ZEN,;;You can go ahead.
YOOSUNG,lolololol Sucks to be you.
MC,I’m going to go by myself.
ZEN,lololol You can eat with me.
ZEN,I can make you pizza.
ZEN,Handmade is better for your health.
JAEHEE,…
MC,You get fat.
JAEHEE,Agreed.
YOOSUNG,!?
JAEHEE,lol
ZEN,lololololol
JAEHEE,"Anyways, do not advertise any commercial product. We have not received any product placement."
YOOSUNG,"Paparazzi Pizza,"
YOOSUNG,"Master Pizza,"
YOOSUNG,Pizza Hat
YOOSUNG,Don’t Me Know Pizza
YOOSUNG,U never get sick of it if you rotate brands.
YOOSUNG,I only get a discount with Paparazzi though.
JAEHEE,"Anyways, the Jalapeno piece had a terrible script."
JAEHEE,but I think Zen’s acting made up for it a lot.
ZEN,It was amazing that all the tickets were sold out when the story is so strange.
JAEHEE,The cost to view a musical
JAEHEE,is nothing compared to getting to see you.
ZEN,Really…?
JAEHEE,Yes.
JAEHEE,Epecially
JAEHEE,to see you… do things like that.
ZEN,"Well… If you say so it must be true, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,^^
YOOSUNG,I should order pizza!
MC,I want to see that musical too.
JAEHEE,I have the DVD at my house.
JAEHEE,I can lend it to you if we get a chance to meet.
MC,I’ll probably order pizza too.
YOOSUNG,lololol I have a comrade!
ZEN,Tsk tsk…
ZEN,Yoosung is still a baby.
MC,I think you’ll do well in anything Zen.
ZEN,Don’t miss a show from now on.
ZEN,I can get you a ticket.
JAEHEE,Please get one for me too.
ZEN,Sure~
YOOSUNG,I’ll be off now~!
ZEN,Probably off to play games.
YOOSUNG,Correct
YOOSUNG,"Got enough rest, must return."
JAEHEE,I’ll have to leave as well.
ZEN,Ya. I should go exercise.
MC,Bye Yoosung.
YOOSUNG,Bye ^^
MC,"Jaehee, good bye^^"
JAEHEE,I’ll get going.
MC,"Zen, good luck working out ^^"
ZEN,Ya
ZEN,You should rest too. Don’t stay up too late ^^
MC,Playing games?
YOOSUNG,I’m hungry so I’m thinking of eating something.
YOOSUNG,I was going to order pizza before
YOOSUNG,but it was too late and they stopped delivery.
YOOSUNG,Learned the valuable lesson to always… order pizza before 9.
MC,"Yoosung, when are you going to bed?"
YOOSUNG,I…
YOOSUNG,don’t sleep a lot anyways ^^
YOOSUNG,Oh right.
YOOSUNG,Did I tell you about the coffee club?
MC,You didn’t.
YOOSUNG,I didn’t?
YOOSUNG,Hmm… I thought I did.
MC,You did.
YOOSUNG,You have a good memory.
YOOSUNG,^^
YOOSUNG,I think I just told you that I made coffee and didn’t tell you the details.
YOOSUNG,The coffee club at our school is pretty famous
YOOSUNG,so I think it has connections with the Barista Association.
YOOSUNG,How about inviting them to the party?
MC,"It’s a good idea, but I’m not sure if we’ll get anything out of it."
YOOSUNG,You think so?
YOOSUNG,"If you think that way, then I guess no choice…"
MC,Sounds good.
YOOSUNG,Then I’ll get in touch with them ^^
MC,Thank you.
YOOSUNG,I’m happy to be of help.
YOOSUNG,^^
MC,Please contact them as soon as you can.
YOOSUNG,"Oh, of course!"
YOOSUNG,I’ll make sure to tell you if my coffee turns out good!
YOOSUNG,I’m still learning how to do it properly… ^^
YOOSUNG,But I really want to make u a cup one day.
MC,Be prepared if it tastes bad ^^
YOOSUNG,omg…
YOOSUNG,I’ll do my best T_T
MC,Thank you ^^
YOOSUNG,No need.
YOOSUNG,I’m happy if ur happy.
YOOSUNG,I’ll be off for a moment to play games lol
YOOSUNG,I’ll be back again ^^
ZEN,"Yoosung, where are you going?"
MC,"Hello, Zen ^^"
ZEN,"MC, hello ^^"
MC,Yoosung is off to play games~.
YOOSUNG,Ya. Bye Zen~
YOOSUNG,I’m off line!
ZEN,That game of his…
ZEN,He should use that time to buy groceries.
ZEN,And live like a proper human being.
ZEN,When I lived by myself at his age you know~!
ZEN,I cooked my meals
ZEN,and lived a healthy and fulfilling
ZEN,….
ZEN,No way that ever happened.
ZEN,I remember almost being killed while riding my motorbike…
ZEN,I might have a photo…
ZEN,Found it.
ZEN,"I got in an accident while riding that, and V took me to the hospital and saved my life."
MC,Omg… scary.
ZEN,I know right?
ZEN,I feel the same way looking back at my past.
MC,You really owe V your life.
ZEN,I do.
ZEN,I went through a lot with V.
ZEN,I’ll tell you when I get the chance.
MC,You don’t deserve to say anything to Yoosung.
ZEN,I guess.
ZEN,Haha…
ZEN,Come to think of it…
ZEN,The people from the model agency I met with yesterday seemed pretty nice.
ZEN,"I wonder if you like good looking guys, too?"
MC,I have a pretty picky taste.
ZEN,It’s good to have a taste.
ZEN,I hope my looks are your taste.
ZEN,^^
MC,I don’t really care for looks.
ZEN,You tend to care more for their personality?
ZEN,Everyone says that but when someone with good looks and a good job comes up…
ZEN,They always say… Oh! I was destined to be with that person!
ZEN,lololol
ZEN,But I believe that MC is different…
ZEN,I really don’t care for looks either.
ZEN,I know too well that it’s only a shell.
ZEN,"Since Yoosung recommended party guests to you,"
ZEN,I have to do the same.
ZEN,How about the modeling agency I’m going to meet tomorrow?
ZEN,I don’t know if I’ll get to work with them…
ZEN,But it’s good to have good looking people at the party.
MC,I’ll think about it.
ZEN,Yes. You should consider it.
ZEN,I’ll follow your decision without any question.
MC,Invite them!
ZEN,Okay. I’ll talk to them.
ZEN,Separate from my job ^^
ZEN,Then I’ll be off now.
ZEN,They say your skin recovers itself from midnight to 2.
ZEN,It’s just a saying
ZEN,but I want to believe it.
ZEN,"If you want to believe it with me, you can go to sleep right after me ^^"
MC,lolol That’s interesting. Good night ^^
ZEN,Okay ^^
ZEN,"Good night, little lady."
MC,Sleep tight.
ZEN,Okay. Bye.
MC,When is Jumin coming?
JAEHEE,Mr. Han will arrive at the airport this morning.
MC,"Jaehee, you’re still awake?"
JAEHEE,Yes. I’m usually awake at this hour.
JAEHEE,It is very late.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han said he was going to meet the Oil Prince on his business trip…
JAEHEE,I only hope everything went well.
MC,You’re still thinking about work this late. That’s amazing.
JAEHEE,Oh.
JAEHEE,Thank you for thinking so.
JAEHEE,To be honest… there aren’t many who consider me that.
JAEHEE,Everyone thinks… that I’m blessed.
JAEHEE,Of course they aren’t wrong.
MC,"To be honest, I’m jealous of you."
JAEHEE,Ha….
JAEHEE,That’s the problem.
JAEHEE,"As I am assisting the great Mr. Han, many women are jealous of me in a good and bad way."
JAEHEE,…I understand it.
MC,Everyone needs compliments and encouragement.
JAEHEE,You are a very kind person.
JAEHEE,It is very rare to find people like you around me.
JAEHEE,I feel… a little bit healed.
MC,Oil Prince! I’m sure he must be very rich.
JAEHEE,He’s one of Mr. Han’s oldest acquaintances with great wealth.
JAEHEE,"Oil prices have dropped considerably these days, but he is still enormously wealthy."
JAEHEE,Please excuse me. I have to get some sleep.
MC,"Hurry and rest, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Yes… Thank you.
MC,Good bye.
JAEHEE,Bye.
MC,"Seven, get a good night’s rest?"
707,Heya MC
707,Ya. Slept like a rock.
707,I don’t feel tired physically..
707,But
707,"mentally, my stress level is MAX"
707,How do I get rid of this stress…?!
MC,You should play games.
707,o_o Game??
707,lol
707,I’d rather make one. Playing it gets boring pretty fast lol
707,Hmm.
707,I summon Yoosung! Abracadabra
MC,Omg. He really came.
707,heya
YOOSUNG,Hmm?
YOOSUNG,I smell a trap somewhere…
707,What were u doing?
707,So late at night lol
YOOSUNG,I was just about to drink a cup of coffee and play games.
YOOSUNG,I started learning how to brew coffee from a club yesterday.
707,Coffee…?
707,Ur learning how to make coffee…???
YOOSUNG,Yep ^^
707,No way. U can’t.
YOOSUNG,What?

YOOSUNG,Yeah… Why?
707,Big trouble…
YOOSUNG,What trouble?

MC,Yoosung… what do we do now?
YOOSUNG,Why?
YOOSUNG,Did something happen?
707,Gah… I was about to tell MC.
707,"So, I check the health reports of all the members…"
YOOSUNG,"Okay… Ur not saying that I can’t dringak coffxee, r u?"
YOOSUNG,*drink coffee?
MC,Ya. U’ll be in trouble if u drink coffee.

707,"Seeing ur typos above, it seems like ur showing symptoms are showing already."
707,U can never ever!!! drink coffee.
707,"If u do, ur hands will start shaking and u’ll faint eventually."
YOOSUNG,Nah
YOOSUNG,I don’t have that kind of allergy.
YOOSUNG,No way~
707,…
707,I’m sorry.
707,U’ve already lost trust in me
707,so u r not listening
YOOSUNG,?
YOOSUNG,For real?
707,Ur gonna faint. For real.
YOOSUNG,Seriously?! Ur kidding right?
MC,You should prepare yourself.
707,Ya. Go prepare to faint.
707,You are going to faint today.
707,And there’s a chance you might never wake up again…
YOOSUNG,Why!?
707,You have the “Pass Out After Drinking Caffeine Syndrome”
YOOSUNG,??? What is that?
YOOSUNG,I don’t understand what you mean.
YOOSUNG,A disease like that actually exists?!
MC,Ya. It exists.
YOOSUNG,!!
707,Ya
707,…Don’t get so surprised.
YOOSUNG,Okay…
707,The disease called “Pass Out After Drinking Caffeine Syndrome”
707,It
707,exists
707,for sure.
707,I look at foreign reports every day.
707,Wiki picture
YOOSUNG,!!!
707,…It’s a rare disease.
MC,Last year there were about 1024 deaths in the country…
707,Oh! That number’s nice. It’s the 10th multiple of 2.
YOOSUNG,Omg. Can’t believe I have such a serious disease T_T
YOOSUNG,I’m so svchoecked to type pertoperly T_T
YOOSUNG,What’s going to happen to me T_T
YOOSUNG,Am I gonna faint soon???
707,According to my data
707,u’ll faint some time between 9 and 10.
YOOSUNG,T_T…
YOOSUNG,I guess it could have been worse. I don’t have class in the morning.
MC,A stroke of good luck in this misfortune.
YOOSUNG,I should at least pass out at home T_T
707,Ya
YOOSUNG,crying emoji
YOOSUNG,Thanks for telling me Seven.
707,lol it’s nothing
MC,Call me if anything happens.
YOOSUNG,Okay. Thank you so much T_T
707,Oh.
707,I recommend drinking chocolate milk before u faint.
707,U have to increase ur blood pressure if u want to wake up faster.
707,I’m worried…T_T
YOOSUNG,Okay…
YOOSUNG,Thank you. MC you too…
MC,No need ^^
YOOSUNG,I should know my body better.
YOOSUNG,Never knew I had something like this…
YOOSUNG,It’s confusing but…
YOOSUNG,I’ll deal with it wisely.
707,Ya. Dealing it wisely is the way to go.
707,…I’m glad to be of help.
707,"Ur young, so u’ll wake up quickly if u do faint, so don’t worry too much."
YOOSUNG,Okay…
YOOSUNG,I shouldn’t drink coffee anymore.
707,Oh… I got work again.

MC,"Seven, look out for my health too."
707,U can trust me… ^^
YOOSUNG,That’s good thinking…MC.

YOOSUNG,MC…
YOOSUNG,If I faint and don’t wake up…
YOOSUNG,Can u wake me up with a… a… a kiss?
YOOSUNG,I’m not trying to be weird.
YOOSUNG,I just want to wake up and help open the party…
MC,I’ll wake you up…
YOOSUNG,Oh…! Thank you.
YOOSUNG,Blushing emoji
YOOSUNG,"First, I should get some chocolate milk…"
YOOSUNG,I’m gonna go to the supermarket~!
MC,"Jaehee, are you still waiting for Jumin?"
JAEHEE,"Oh, MC."
JAEHEE,You remembered ^^
JAEHEE,No.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han came back safely an hour ago…
JAEHEE,I turned on the messenger since he’d be home by now.
MC,"Hello,  Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Hello.
JAEHEE,Hmm..
JAEHEE,…;;
JAEHEE,“Pass Out After Drinking Caffeine Syndrome”
JAEHEE,How childish.
MC,Seven is really funny lol
JAEHEE,"Still, he should not go out of line."
JAEHEE,"Men tend to be more aggressive, so I’ll just leave it…"
MC,I feel bad for Yoosung.
JAEHEE,I agree.
JAEHEE,It’s a bit… too much to make fun of a person younger than yourself.
JAEHEE,"Mr. Han, are you back?"
JUMIN,Yes.
MC,"Jumin, how was your flight?"
JUMIN,It was fine.
JUMIN,Although Assistant Kang wasn’t there to greet me.
JUMIN,"Why didn’t you come to the airport, Assistant Kang?"
JAEHEE,I suddenly had to run an errand so the general manager went to greet you instead.
JUMIN,"Yes. Thanks to that, it was awkward on my way home."
MC,How was the meeting with the Oil Prince?
JUMIN,"You have a fairly good memory to remember who I was meeting, MC."
JAEHEE,I see you are interested in what’s going on with the organization.
JUMIN,The meeting…
JUMIN,"went okay. He said he wanted to see some Korean dramas, so I have him some DVDs"
JAEHEE,Which DVDs?
JUMIN,It was called… Love and Warrior or Battle?
JUMIN,The reviews said it’s fun. The Korean wave is pretty amazing.
JAEHEE,Hmm;; Yes.
JAEHEE,That’s a relief.
MC,Why don’t we invite the Oil Prince to the party?
JUMIN,I think that’s a good idea.
JAEHEE,It is. I didn’t think of it before.
JAEHEE,I will contact his assistant.
JAEHEE,"Since I took care of the errand, I’ll return to the company."
JUMIN,No.
JUMIN,You should rest today.
JUMIN,^^
JAEHEE,??
JAEHEE,Why are you suddenly being so generous?
JAEHEE,Did you drink oil instead of water…?
JUMIN,No.
MC,"Jaehee, I think that’s a bit rude."
JUMIN,It’s not rude but
JUMIN,I hope you do not misconstrue my genuine intentions.
MC,How hard did you make her work for her to say that…?
JAEHEE,…^^
JAEHEE,I will not say a thing.
JUMIN,"Elizabeth the 3rd had such a rough time in a foreign environment, so I want to take care of her at home."
JAEHEE,"In other words, you will not go to work."
JAEHEE,So I get to stay home… as well?
JUMIN,Haha yes.
JAEHEE,What should I tell Mr. Chairman?
JUMIN,Tell him the Oil Prince liked me so much that he wanted to do a phone conference.
MC,You really like the cat.
JUMIN,Haha…
JUMIN,She’s my love.
JAEHEE,-_-
MC,Still I do not think it’s right to skip work.
JAEHEE,I think so as well.
MC,Jaehee was on standby the whole weekend because of you.
JAEHEE,Oh. You do not have to mention that…
JUMIN,Did the girls form an alliance? Funny.
JUMIN,"Anyways, I said I’m not going."
JUMIN,I can’t risk her getting a cold.
JAEHEE,Alright.
JUMIN,I will go to bed with Elizabeth the 3rd.
JUMIN,Good bye.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han…?
JAEHEE,I think that Mr. Han is incredibly intelligent and talented.
JAEHEE,Except… at times he puts me in trouble by doing whatever he desires.
MC,It may be difficult but what can you do…
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,My hobby is my only escape route.
MC,"Cheer up, Jaehee!"
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,You may just be saying it… but sometimes those words help me a great deal.
JAEHEE,After all
JAEHEE,I am only an assistant.
JAEHEE,This is a photo I took last year.
JAEHEE,When I look at this photo
JAEHEE,I think once again about where I stand.
JAEHEE,I…
JAEHEE,am only a helper.
JAEHEE,My emotions do not matter.
MC,Don’t say sad things like that.
JAEHEE,I am becoming emotional.
JAEHEE,…Thank you for listening to me.
JAEHEE,I mean it.
MC,Everything will work out.
JAEHEE,Yes. I hope so.
JAEHEE,I have to go finish up writing a report so I’ll have to go.
JAEHEE,Thank you for your kind words.
JAEHEE,Then…
MC,"Good bye, Jaehee."
MC,"Jaehee, are you busy today?"
JAEHEE,Yes. Same as usual.
MC,Hello.
JAEHEE,Hello.
JAEHEE,"Actually I had something to tell you, MC"
JAEHEE,…I felt a bit melancholic last night so I surfed the net.
JAEHEE,And I came across a volunteer organization called Homeless Rescue Team.
JAEHEE,The organization seemed diligent and clean…
JAEHEE,So I made a personal donation.
JAEHEE,…I hope it goes to good use.
MC,You did something good ^^
JAEHEE,Thank you. ^^
MC,Why that organization?
JAEHEE,My criteria for a good charity organization is its transparency and efficiency.
JAEHEE,"I thought the organization met the two standards, so I made a donation."
JAEHEE,Although the better way would be for me to do the volunteering work myself…
MC,"If that’s the case, how about inviting the group to the party?"
JAEHEE,That’s a good idea.
JAEHEE,I haven’t known it for long… so I’ll look into the organization more and have them contact you.
MC,Those are good standards.
JAEHEE,Thank you for thinking so.
JAEHEE,My heart feels warmer on days I make a donation.
JAEHEE,I recommend any member who has money to spare to try making a donation.
707,Ya. I donated a lot too.
MC,"Hello, 707."
707,Heya MC.
JAEHEE,That’s unexpected. Where did you donate to?
707,A group of developers… and what was the other place.
707,Anyways I donated my talent and gave some lectures. lol
YOOSUNG,Seven T_T
MC,"Yoosung, why are you crying."
YOOSUNG,MC…
YOOSUNG,The time is coming…
MC,I never knew you did things like that.
707,Ahem lol
707,I went to the developers meeting and gave them USBs with viruses as gifts ^^
JAEHEE,That is not donating…
707,Everyone will study to try to get rid of it.

YOOSUNG,It’s time for me to faint soon T_T
YOOSUNG,I drank chocolate milk.
707,Oh. You did?
YOOSUNG,"Right now, I’m just lying on my bed covered in a blanket."
YOOSUNG,"This will do, right?"
MC,Native Yoosung… Good bye.
JAEHEE,Ya… Good bye.
707,"Don’t worry, I’ll make sure he goes well."
MC,lololol So cute.
YOOSUNG,I am a bit cute.
YOOSUNG,"I’ll come back alive, MC!"
707,Oh!! Right!!

707,For not being able to protect u.
YOOSUNG,You’re not saying…
MC,^^;
JAEHEE,This is such a joke.
MC,lololololol
YOOSUNG,Why is this funny T_T
YOOSUNG,You guys are mean…
YOOSUNG,"But I’ll miss you, MC…"
MC,Hurry and turn on the humidifier right now!!
707,Ya. Hurry up.
YOOSUNG,Nooooo T_T
YOOSUNG,My hagdnds are shaking!
JAEHEE,What is he saying?
707,I think he meant his hands are shaking.
YOOSUNG,"I may never wake up again, right?"
707,"Ya. Well, something like that."
YOOSUNG,My last words…
YOOSUNG,Gahh… I’m tearing up.
YOOSUNG,"I love everyone, and I’ll forgive V. And"
707,You forgave him. Good.
YOOSUNG,"Seven, I’m sorry! I accidentally stepped on ur figurine two weeks ago and secretly threw it away…"
JAEHEE,lol
YOOSUNG,"MC… We didn’t get to know each other well, but I liked you."
MC,!?
YOOSUNG,Don’t react like that T_T
MC,So cute lolol
YOOSUNG,I’ll remain as the cute boy till the end…
YOOSUNG,"Elizabeth, I’m sorry I couldn’t play with you more. And my first love in fifth grade, Areum, I’m sorry I didn’t return ur eraser, and mom and dad, thank you for sending me to college."
YOOSUNG,Huh…
YOOSUNG,Seven left?
YOOSUNG,But when do u think I’ll faint?
JAEHEE,You will not faint.
YOOSUNG,Why!?
MC,The clock stopped in this world.
JAEHEE,What are you talking about.
JAEHEE,Let’s stop fooling Yoosung.
MC,You were tricked.
JAEHEE,Ya…
YOOSUNG,What…?
JAEHEE,You are a fish on a hook.
JAEHEE,Struggling to stay alive.
YOOSUNG,!?
YOOSUNG,"Se, seven?"
YOOSUNG,Where did he go!?
JAEHEE,He ran away.
YOOSUNG,…I…
YOOSUNG,…I don’t have an incurable disease?
JAEHEE,He said it’s rare. No one said it’s incurable.
JAEHEE,And it’s not even a rare disease.
YOOSUNG,Thank god… Thank god…!
YOOSUNG,I’m so glad to be alive… Seriously… I thought…
YOOSUNG,Gah… I’m gonna cry.
YOOSUNG,I love everyone.
YOOSUNG,Really….
JAEHEE,;; Aren’t you mad?
YOOSUNG,Mad?
MC,"Yoosung, you are so naive.;;;"
JAEHEE,You are very naive.
JAEHEE,You took Luciel’s lie so seriously.
MC,Seven lied to you that you have a disease.
YOOSUNG,Huh…?!
YOOSUNG,omg… he did.
YOOSUNG,My god…
YOOSUNG,"MC, comfort me…"
YOOSUNG,I was completely fooled T_T
MC,Congrats on being fooled.
JAEHEE,Congratulation.
YOOSUNG,I am not happy about this!
MC,There there…
YOOSUNG,I think he did something like this before. He got me again… T_T
YOOSUNG,He’s so mean…
JAEHEE,How foolish to fall in to the same trap several times.
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,"Seven has a lot of data and knows a lot, so I end up believing whatever he says…"
YOOSUNG,"MC, even if we become good friends, u can’t fool me like that. Okay?"
MC,"I’ll protect you, little boy."
YOOSUNG,Omg…
YOOSUNG,So you are older than me…
JAEHEE,I do not wish to partake in that conversation.
MC,You should tell Jaehee that.
JAEHEE,Why me;;;
JAEHEE,I do not fool people.
MC,I’ll do what my heart desires.
YOOSUNG,Gah…
YOOSUNG,Is that heart… beating for me?
JAEHEE,Did you put something strange in your chocolate milk?
YOOSUNG,I’m so full from the milk.
YOOSUNG,I’ll go play another round just to get myself back to reality.
JAEHEE,Playing games in the morning…? I wonder if you will actually play just one round.
YOOSUNG,Probably two rounds… or actually three.
JAEHEE,"Anyways, I am glad this prank is over."
JAEHEE,I should go now. Still have a lot of work to do at home.
MC,"Have a good day, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Thank you. Bye
MC,"Yoosung, cheer up. ^^"
YOOSUNG,Thank you! I will!
MC,It’s V!
V,"MC, hello."
MC,"V, you’re online."
V,Yes. I hope you’ve been well.
V,I see I’ve come at an awkward time.
V,I came to announce the party schedule.
V,I am sorry my reply is late. It must be uncomfortable for you.
MC,It’s fine.
V,Yoosung is online as well.
YOOSUNG,Yeah…
MC,"Hello, Yoosung!"
V,Oh. Yoosung. You’re here.
YOOSUNG,Hello…. MC.
V,I’m sorry that I can’t come in more often.
YOOSUNG,So you decided to hold the party?
V,Yes.
V,I’ve been keeping an eye out the past couple of days…
V,And I think MC is safe.
V,Luciel built a security system just in case something happens.
YOOSUNG,Seven said…
YOOSUNG,he was locked in at work;;
YOOSUNG,Did you do it by any chance?
V,Luciel said that?
V,That’s… a pity.
V,It’s probably because he had multiple projects at the same time and had to hurry up and finish one.
YOOSUNG,Hmm.
V,I actually discussed with Luciel the earliest date we can hold the party.
V,"It may feel a bit too soon, but I think it would be best to hold it in a week."
YOOSUNG,A week!?
MC,"What do you think, Yoosung?"
YOOSUNG,I don’t really think it’s a good idea.
YOOSUNG,We might not be able to gather a lot of people if it’s in a week.
V,I plan to have a simpler party this time.
YOOSUNG,Shouldn’t u have asked for our opinion before deciding that?
V,Considering the situation… the party must be held a week from now.
YOOSUNG,What situation?
V,It’s the first party MC is going to hold.
V,I thought she would be too burdened if the party becomes too grand.
MC,You cared for me.
YOOSUNG,"You have a very positive mind, MC…"
YOOSUNG,I would have been a bit angry if I were you for not discussing this with me.
V,"Thank you for being understanding, MC."
YOOSUNG,I do not understand why MC is accepting this so easily.
MC,It would have been nice if you discussed this together…
YOOSUNG,I know.
YOOSUNG,The members of this organization aren’t here to just take orders from you.
YOOSUNG,Shouldn’t u have discussed this with us?
V,I apologize for deciding things my way this time.
V,"If there is anything else to discuss, I will."
MC,I don’t feel burdened…
V,"But still, it is dangerous to have the party too big from the beginning."
V,I think it will be better to expand it gradually.
YOOSUNG,…
V,There are members who still have good relationships with prior party guests
V,so things will be carried out fast.
V,If MC handles this work well
V,then I think there won’t be a problem with holding the party next week.
MC,I will have to work together with the organization members.
V,Yes. That’s true.
V,Team work is important.
MC,We should hurry and gather guests.
V,Everyone will work together to gather guests.
V,"Since we do not have much time, I hope you don’t go too overboard."
YOOSUNG,Hosting a party in a week… It feels impossible.
YOOSUNG,"If we were going to hold the party in a week, we could have had at least 60 parties in the past year and a half."
V,You know that we couldn’t hold the party because Zika is not here.
YOOSUNG,We could have done it without her.
YOOSUNG,If only you took her place.
V,I… can’t replace Rika.
YOOSUNG,I think that you would have been able to do it.
YOOSUNG,You’re the one who created RFA with Rika.
YOOSUNG,"But ever since she passed away, you haven’t done anything for the organization."
YOOSUNG,Other than suddenly appearing like this and telling us your decisions.
YOOSUNG,I feel like you are only trying to avoid the organization’s work and traces of her.
V,You are misunderstanding me.
MC,Maybe V has his own reasons?
YOOSUNG,"If he does, it would be nice for him to tell us…"
YOOSUNG,It’s so hard to just even talk to him
YOOSUNG,how could I know what’s going on with him?
MC,"Yoosung, you should calm down a bit."
YOOSUNG,…Okay.
YOOSUNG,I was a bit worked up.
YOOSUNG,Thank you for pointing it out.
V,I’m sorry… that I was that way.
YOOSUNG,That’s not what I want to hear.
YOOSUNG,I just feel like you’re trying to run away.
V,That’s not true.
YOOSUNG,From Rika.
MC,But Yoosung does have a point.
V,It is not that I don’t acknowledge what Yoosung is saying.
V,I understand that he does not trust me.
YOOSUNG,It’s not as if we just have one or two doubts.
YOOSUNG,The organization was so honest before.
YOOSUNG,I feel like it’s covered with secrets now because of you.
YOOSUNG,And this is a different story but…
YOOSUNG,Why do you only discuss important things with Seven?
V,Luciel is in charge of handling classified information?
YOOSUNG,Why do we need classified information in this organization?
YOOSUNG,I feel like you are using Seven to make more secrets.
YOOSUNG,"If you tell him to, Seven will just like to us, right?"
V,Luciel did nothing wrong.
V,The reason why we have classified information is… because there were a lot of things Rika took care of while maintaining secrecy.
V,She collected all that information at her apartment.
YOOSUNG,"If what you are saying is true,"
YOOSUNG,then can’t we just get rid of the classified information… now that Rika is gone?
V,It is not that simple.
V,I’m sorry. I’ll explain more in detail next time when I get the chance.
V,I have to leave now.
V,"When I have time, I’ll participate as soon as possible to help with the party."
V,I hope you do not react too emotionally to what I say.
V,"I really cherish you, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,…
V,I’ll leave now.
V,Thank you for trying hard for the organization. I’m always thankful…
MC,"V, good bye."
V,Good bye.
MC,"I think deep in his heart, Yoosung understands too."
V,I hope so.
MC,Cheer up. We’re able to hold the party now anyways.
YOOSUNG,Yes… You’re right.
YOOSUNG,Sorry. I was too emotional.
YOOSUNG,I can’t control myself in front V.
YOOSUNG,It’s been more than a year and a half since I heard his voice.
YOOSUNG,"He should feel like a stranger at this point, but that’s not the case…"
YOOSUNG,…But I’m sure Rika will be happy about this decision up there.
YOOSUNG,But I don’t know how we’ll manage to hold the party in a week…
YOOSUNG,I’m worried it might get too difficult for you.
MC,I’ll be fine. We can all try hard together.
YOOSUNG,Thank you for saying that.
YOOSUNG,I still don’t like V…
YOOSUNG,but I feel healed thanks to you.
YOOSUNG,"I’m sorry for being such a child, MC."
YOOSUNG,"I’m… a bit embarrassed, so I’ll leave."
JAEHEE,First…
JAEHEE,the date is set. That’s a relief.
MC,"Hello, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,"Hello, MC."
JAEHEE,I thought Mr. Han was going to spend the day with his cat;;
MC,"Jaehee, how is your break?"
JAEHEE,I was at home but was forced back to the company…
MC,Did Jumin interfere again?
JAEHEE,"Not directly… but if you think about it, that is what happened."
JAEHEE,Mr. Chairman suddenly scheduled a business trip for Mr. Han
JAEHEE,so I had to return to the company.
MC,omg…
JAEHEE,Mr. Chairman suddenly scheduled a business trip for Mr. Han
JAEHEE,so I had to return to the company.
JAEHEE,I thought Mr. Han was going to spend the day with his cat;;
JAEHEE,"To be more exact, Mr. Han"
JAEHEE,was “dragged” away…
JAEHEE,But…
JAEHEE,he left his cat with me.
JAEHEE,He told me to send a photo so I did.
JAEHEE,This creature called cat
JAEHEE,It wouldn’t be bad to leave it in an empty house for a day.
JAEHEE,Don’t you think so?
JAEHEE,Can a cat not stay in an empty house for even a single day?
JAEHEE,Thanks to that
JAEHEE,…the company is the cat’s playground.
JAEHEE,Is Luciel here?
JAEHEE,He could come here to play with the cat for a while
JAEHEE,or how about just taking it and keeping it temporarily?
MC,"Yoosung, hello~"
YOOSUNG,MC ^^ I’m here
MC,I feel too bad for the cat to leave it with Seven.
JAEHEE,…That is true. Even the cat would feel safer under my care.
JAEHEE,"Besides, if I leave it with Seven"
JAEHEE,Mr. Han will go crazy again.
JAEHEE,I haven’t even seen Seven in this chat room recently.
YOOSUNG,Seven doesn’t log in very often.
YOOSUNG,He might be meeting with V and planning something in secret…!
MC,He may be.
YOOSUNG,"Yeah… To be honest, that’s what I think."
MC,Trust him a bit more. He is important to the organization.
JAEHEE,MC has a point.
JAEHEE,If you do not trust the decision maker in this organization
JAEHEE,you will not feel happy even if you remain in the group.
YOOSUNG,…I’ll try to do so.
YOOSUNG,If I could get to trust V.
YOOSUNG,Really…
YOOSUNG,What the hell is Seven doing?
YOOSUNG,I still haven’t gotten back at him about that chocolate milk!
YOOSUNG,Oh right.
YOOSUNG,I… have shocking news!
YOOSUNG,Guess what it is!
MC,Did you get a girlfriend?
YOOSUNG,No…
YOOSUNG,Don’t do that to me T_T
YOOSUNG,That’s not it…
MC,Are you pregnant?
JAEHEE,-_-
YOOSUNG,lololol
MC,"You didn’t quit gaming, did you?"
YOOSUNG,I did.
JAEHEE,!?
YOOSUNG,I quit LoLoL.
YOOSUNG,I want to raise my TOEIC scores before my finals.
MC,Why TOEIC all of a sudden?
YOOSUNG,Oh. That’s because…
MC,Amazing. Quitting all at once!
YOOSUNG,I know right? lolol
YOOSUNG,I was surprised myself.
YOOSUNG,I thought to myself that I have to quit and I just did it.
JAEHEE,That is a bit surprising.
YOOSUNG,"To be honest, out of everyone in this organization… I think I’m the most normal one."
YOOSUNG,I want to build up my resume…!
MC,You’re finally becoming an adult.
JAEHEE,It is too early to feel relief.
JAEHEE,You cannot think lightly of game withdrawal symptoms.
YOOSUNG,I am not affected by things like that!
JAEHEE,We’ll see.
YOOSUNG,I’m going to take this opportunity to build up my resume.
MC,"Yoosung, you’re not that normal."
YOOSUNG,What… Really?
JAEHEE,I guess…
JAEHEE,Knowing the members of RFA itself is not normal.
JAEHEE,"Although, a college student addicted to games is normal."
YOOSUNG,I want to try hard and become someone special like everyone else.
MC,Don’t really like guys who only have good resumes.
YOOSUNG,Oh… I knew it.
YOOSUNG,You know how to look into people’s hearts.
JAEHEE,Parents always say.
JAEHEE,Marriage is reality.
YOOSUNG,Love is reality.
JAEHEE,That’s romantic but will love put food on your plate?
YOOSUNG,"Jaehee, you’re so cynical~!"
JAEHEE,It’s important to build up your resume…
JAEHEE,But I think it’s more important
JAEHEE,to know what you want to do.
YOOSUNG,Like a dream job?
JAEHEE,"Similar, but it must be realistic."
JAEHEE,It is dangerous to walk on a path without a clear goal.
YOOSUNG,If I pass exams and get good English grades
YOOSUNG,don’t I automatically get a job after college?
MC,Yoosung… You’re so cute.
YOOSUNG,Hehe
JAEHEE,The employment market is not a vending machine.
JAEHEE,You do not get a job just by putting in a good resume.
MC,Tsk tsk…
JAEHEE,…Tsk tsk seconded.
YOOSUNG,I’m suddenly so confused!
JAEHEE,This is my advice as someone who has more experience in life.
JAEHEE,I also simply went with the flow
JAEHEE,without a clear goal…
JAEHEE,just thinking all I had to do
JAEHEE,was try hard.
JAEHEE,And I am satisfied to a certain degree with my current assistant job…
JAEHEE,But I am worried it will be difficult to advance further.
JAEHEE,And now I have forgotten
JAEHEE,what I wanted to do.
YOOSUNG,No…
JAEHEE,It is quite sad but I am comforted by the fact that I earn a living.
MC,So sad T_T The life of an employee.
YOOSUNG,Gahh~ It’s so sad.
JAEHEE,"It is, but this is the bitter reality."
MC,"Still you are a capable and awesome career woman, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,I feel a bit better.
YOOSUNG,"MC, what do you think about me studying for TOEIC?"
MC,You can get a girlfriend at the TOEIC academy or in a club.
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,I’m not looking forward to it to be honest…
JAEHEE,An academy is a great place for young people to get along.
JAEHEE,Why don’t you stay possible?
YOOSUNG,"Jaehee, you’re against Zen getting a girlfriend."
YOOSUNG,Then why are you telling me this…
JAEHEE,"Because you are not Zen, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,This is hard;;;
MC,I think trying something new always helps.
YOOSUNG,"Wow…! Honestly, I think so too."
YOOSUNG,"Last year, I learned the awesome Korean drinking culture at the Wear Proper Socks club."
JAEHEE,I understand you mean well but I don’t think the example is appropriate.
YOOSUNG,Haha.
YOOSUNG,I…
YOOSUNG,"want to do something more meaningful than playing games,"
YOOSUNG,I want to become… stronger.
YOOSUNG,Although I’m not a genius like Seven
YOOSUNG,or an elite like Jaehee…
JAEHEE,"If that is the case, you need a specific plan."
YOOSUNG,Yes… So just before.
YOOSUNG,I raged a little bit…
YOOSUNG,and I looked into this group called Shoe Size TOEIC Scores.
YOOSUNG,And everyone has big feet.
JAEHEE,;;;
MC,"lololol Yoosung, do you have big feet?"
YOOSUNG,I’m… a size 260.
YOOSUNG,Haha. I’m blushing.
MC,Should I invite them to the party…?
JAEHEE,Are you serious?
YOOSUNG,I think it might be a good idea! lol
YOOSUNG,I’ll tell them to contact you.
YOOSUNG,Although they aren’t good as their shoe sizes… they are very positive.
JAEHEE,I’ll get going now.
YOOSUNG,I’m gonna go flip through some TOEIC practice books~
MC,"Good luck, Yoosung ^^"
YOOSUNG,Thank you ^^
MC,"Good bye, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Yes. Good bye.
MC,"Zen, what are you doing?"
ZEN,I was looking into the mirror.
ZEN,My reflection is so beautiful I can’t take my eyes off it.
MC,Hey! It’s handsome Zen.
ZEN,"Haha… You have a good eye, MC."
ZEN,You know what.
ZEN,I was just looking into the mirror.
ZEN,My reflection is so beautiful I can’t turn my eyes away.
ZEN,I think I understand what it means for the mirror to get jealous.
ZEN,And also.
ZEN,The model agency I met today asked me if I could model for them.
ZEN,Man…
ZEN,This chiseled face is bringing work from everywhere.
ZEN,It’s a problem.
MC,On the brink of madness.
ZEN,My looks make me this way.
ZEN,It’s hard for me too… Seriously.
MC,It’s a serious problem. What do we do? Everyone’s eyes will freeze.
ZEN,That’s what I mean…
ZEN,I see that our beauty standards are the same.
MC,Narcissist…
ZEN,A narcissist is a narcissist because he’s handsome.
ZEN,lol
MC,"Yoosung, you’re not going to play games?"
YOOSUNG,I said I quit LOLOL. lol
ZEN,Is that for real…
YOOSUNG,Yup. I’m studying for TOEIC.
ZEN,Our kid has changed;;
MC,Ssup Yoosung.
YOOSUNG,Ssup~!
ZEN,Who the hell says sup these days. Where did you put your good senses?
YOOSUNG,Why lol. You used a 90s greeting too last time.
ZEN,"Seeing how I look in the mirror, I don’t want to tell people how old I am lol"
ZEN,I’ll forever be the young hot guy.
YOOSUNG,Zen
YOOSUNG,When you’re too narcissistic you sort of become douchey..
ZEN,Did you just call me douchey…
ZEN,I’m good looking. What can I do? lol
YOOSUNG,Since we’re talking about looks.
YOOSUNG,Don’t I look okay?
MC,lol Not bad.
YOOSUNG,Really?
YOOSUNG,I guess I’m not really your type… T_T
MC,Not my type.
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,That’s sad…
MC,You’re okay.
YOOSUNG,Oh… Thank you!
ZEN,What’s to thank?;;;
ZEN,She just said you’re okay.
MC,You’re attractive ^^
YOOSUNG,"Haha, thanks!"
YOOSUNG,I feel good~
ZEN,You don’t look so bad.
YOOSUNG,Then why can’t I get a girlfriend?
YOOSUNG,Is there something wrong with me?
YOOSUNG,"MC, do you know!?"
MC,Because you’re slow.
ZEN,A little bit…
YOOSUNG,I’m slow!?
YOOSUNG,What… I don’t think so T_T
MC,Because you’re frigid.
ZEN,Ya. Kinda agree with that.
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,I’m so sad I never had a girlfriend.
MC,Because you’re addicted to games.
YOOSUNG,"Then since I quit, I’ll get one now!"
YOOSUNG,Hooray!
ZEN,Hooray;;
ZEN,I think you’ll look more manly if you dress better.
JAEHEE,"1. No, because you are short."
ZEN,"lmaoooo Jaehee, that’s the first thing you want to say? lol"
ZEN,Sorry… She says you’re too short.
MC,"Hello, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Hello.
MC,I like guys who are short.
ZEN,Oh~
YOOSUNG,Oh… My heart just jumped!
YOOSUNG,So I have hope too?
MC,lmao
YOOSUNG,Don’t laugh! T_T
JAEHEE,"2. No, because you spend too much time playing LOLOL"
ZEN,Yup. No more games.
YOOSUNG,I quit~!
JAEHEE,3. You are not wild enough.
ZEN,Yup.
YOOSUNG,!?
MC,Being wild is important!
ZEN,I agree.
YOOSUNG,Then I’m… T_T
ZEN,Try changing yourself like me.
YOOSUNG,Grrrrr grrrrr??
ZEN,What are you doing right now.
JAEHEE,I will continue.
MC,I think that’s a bit subjective.
YOOSUNG,Right?
ZEN,So you admit you’re not wild.
YOOSUNG,Being gentle is a charm on its own~!
JAEHEE,4. Please throw away your hoodie.
ZEN,Uhm.. That’s…;;
YOOSUNG,;; I can’t throw away my hoodie! It’s like my skin!
MC,It’s tacky to be honest.
YOOSUNG,Omg…
ZEN,So straightforward.
YOOSUNG,My feelings…
ZEN,roflololol
MC,I think it’s cute.
YOOSUNG,Haha! See.
YOOSUNG,"I’m just not your type, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Here is a good example.
YOOSUNG,Omg.
ZEN,It’s a photo of me; Why is it framed?
ZEN,I don’t know whose it is but she must really like me lol
MC,I’m going to save this~^^
JAEHEE,Sure^^
MC,No wonder you were so subjective Jaehee.
ZEN,So… you don’t like my photo?
MC,"No, I like it very much."
ZEN,So cute lol
ZEN,"Thanks, MC."
MC,Not really my type…
ZEN,Hmph.
JAEHEE,Matter of taste.
YOOSUNG,It’s too much. I don’t like it.
JAEHEE,^^
ZEN,I am indeed very handsome.
JAEHEE,Yes you are.
ZEN,lol… It’s so impossible.
ZEN,Those looks.
JAEHEE,You will have to live with it. No choice.
ZEN,"Ya… Gosh, this is so hard."
YOOSUNG,My god…
ZEN,Living with such an impressive face.
ZEN,I have no choice but to work out as well.
ZEN,T_T
MC,God. I’m cringing.
YOOSUNG,Me too…
YOOSUNG,I wanna die…
MC,Now I know the true meaning of beauty.
JAEHEE,I agree.
ZEN,Thank you ^^
YOOSUNG,I’m leaving.
YOOSUNG,No one understands me!!
YOOSUNG,Laterz
ZEN,I’m going to go work out now.
JAEHEE,"Yes, maintenance is key."
MC,"Beautiful Zen, have a good work out and see you later."
ZEN,"Okay. My beauty follows the law of conservation, so look forward to it."
MC,"Cheer up, Yoosung~. I feel you~!"
YOOSUNG,Yes… Thank you!
YOOSUNG,Don’t let his narcissism get to you.
YOOSUNG,Good bye ^^
JAEHEE,I think it would be nice if he takes a photo
JAEHEE,while he’s working out…
MC,I want to work out with Zen…
JAEHEE,Do not imagine such ridiculous things.
JAEHEE,Zen is an actor very sensitive to scandals.
MC,"Wet hair, sweat drops rolling down his muscles…"
JAEHEE,Just imagining it
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,Never mind.
JAEHEE,"Oh, right."
JAEHEE,I almost forgot.
JAEHEE,I had something to tell you…
JAEHEE,After being reminded by the fact that Yoosung is a university student
JAEHEE,I sought out a group of the youngest students to be accepted to college.
JAEHEE,They overly like to brag about themselves
JAEHEE,but many of their parents are very successful.
JAEHEE,I think it would be nice if they come to the party. I wanted to know your thoughts.
MC,Hmm… I’ll think about it.
JAEHEE,"Yes, do so."
MC,I think it’ll be nice to invite them.
JAEHEE,Alright. I’ll get in touch.
JAEHEE,I’ll get going too.
JAEHEE,Elizabeth is making a strange noise.
JAEHEE,"Okay, then good bye."
MC,"Good luck looking after the cat, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Thank you for your concerns.
MC,"Seven, hello~"
707,It’s MC~ lol
JAEHEE,Hello.
707,Jaehee’s here too. lol
MC,Jaehee~ You’re here again.
JAEHEE,"MC,"
JAEHEE,Mr. Han is on a business trip so I have some free time.
707,Hey hey
707,lmafoooooo
707,Zen’s narcissism is getting worse by the day.
707,Not long till I refer him to a doctor.
JAEHEE,He has no choice because of his good looks.
JAEHEE,I am only worried that the more popular he becomes
JAEHEE,the greater number of people who will harbor passionate feelings for him.
707,Zen wants to get a girlfriend.
707,That’s good for him lol
JAEHEE,"I repeat,"
JAEHEE,scandals are poison to an actor.
JAEHEE,I am quite worried…
JAEHEE,that MC has feelings for Zen.
JAEHEE,Please tell me the truth.
MC,Are you being jealous?
JAEHEE,I am not.
707,I think she is.
MC,It’s nothing like that~.
JAEHEE,Then I’m glad to hear that.
707,So nosy lol
JAEHEE,I am only saying this for everyone’s interests.
707,Think it’s just for ur interests.
JAEHEE,That is not so.
JAEHEE,It would affect Zen’s career in particular…
JAEHEE,but I think it’s not appropriate for members to date each other regardless.
707,Why do u sound like the dean of a private school?
JAEHEE,"MC, you play a critical role in holding the party."
JAEHEE,I only hope that you recognize your role and responsibility to commence the work with devotion…
707,Jealous?
707,lololol
MC,"Jaehee, relax. lolol"
JAEHEE,Just consider it a warning.
707,"I do think that ur overreacting a bit, Jaehee…"
707,This isn’t a school.
707,U should date whoever u want to lol
JAEHEE,That is not a selfish thought not considering Zen’s career at all.
JAEHEE,Anyways…
MC,I don’t think she’s jealous.
707,"Right. MC, maybe you are jealous lolol"
MC,Do you want to see what real hysteria looks like?
JAEHEE,Hahaha
JAEHEE,That was a bit funny.
707,Hysteric women are so scary~~! >.<
MC,Shut that mouth.
707,Scary~ >.<
JAEHEE,Why are you accusing me?
JAEHEE,You are here just in time. Please take the cat.
JAEHEE,The Elizabeth the 3rd you like so much is right here.
707,I want to see my Elly~
707,But not now…
707,I’m about to pass out..
707,I’m falling…
707,asleep….Zzzz
707,Zzzz
JAEHEE,Who can sleep while typing zzz;;;;….
JAEHEE,He is very useless when I actually need help.
707,Awake again.
MC,Omg
MC,lolol
707,I have something to say.
707,I found her.
707,The lady.
JAEHEE,I’ve already found the Lady of the bracelets.
707,"…Not her, the Lady of the Workbaskets."
JAEHEE,I’m sorry?
JAEHEE,What?
MC,Don’t joke around~
JAEHEE,I can’t even laugh.
JAEHEE,Please stop the boring joke.
MC,Oh! You found the great lady! You are amazing.
707,Ahem!
JAEHEE,Are you serious?
707,lololol
707,I’m serious.
707,She’s an amazing lady who made workbaskets for 15 years.
JAEHEE,How did you find someone like that;;
JAEHEE,"No actually, why did you find someone like that?"
707,^^ The world is full of possibilities.
JAEHEE,Please do not ramble and get straight to the point.
707,Right.
707,Endless possibilities.
707,The beauty of this world.
JAEHEE,What are you talking about.
707,This world! So beautiful!!
MC,It is so beautiful that she put so much passion into making worthless work baskets for 15 years. Do you think he’s aiming to be gap moe?
707,Oh…
707,Someone understands this!!
707,We’re meant to be!?
JAEHEE,-_-
JAEHEE,I actually hope that is the case.
JAEHEE,Then Zen is safe.
707,I thought u said members shouldn’t date each other?
JAEHEE,"As you said, this is not a school."
MC,We’ll have a small wedding at the space station.
707,!!!
707,Wow! I wanted to get married at the space station too!
JAEHEE,The guests will have to risk their lives.
JAEHEE,I will not attend.
MC,Jaehee… I’m hurt T-T
JAEHEE,I am only joking. Please do not be hurt.
MC,I think he’s high on something.
JAEHEE,I agree.
JAEHEE,But…
JAEHEE,He is always like that so I am not even surprised.
JAEHEE,Please do not make me use the same emoji twice
JAEHEE,and tell us what you are really trying to say.
707,We have to invite her to the party.
707,I’ll get to meet the master of workbaskets…!
MC,I’m not going to invite her;;
JAEHEE,I’m relieved.
JAEHEE,Since MC is a normal person.
MC,Let’s invite her!
707,Hell yes!
707,I’ll tell her to send u an email.
707,So excited!!
707,Oh….
707,My eyes are closing…
707,Z
707,Zzz
JAEHEE,He is really
JAEHEE,impossible.
MC,Well… At least he’s funny ^^
JAEHEE,I don’t find him funny at all.
MC,I agree.
JAEHEE,It is quite common to find
JAEHEE,overly intelligent people who are quite not right in their heads.
JAEHEE,…I’ll find comfort in that.
JAEHEE,I will have to research that lady.
JAEHEE,I’d be angry if Seven is messing around again.
MC,"Okay, go ahead~"
JAEHEE,"Yes, good bye."
MC,"Hope he’s not just fishing… Good luck, Jaehee!"
JAEHEE,I hope so as well.
JAEHEE,Then good bye.
MC,"Yoosung, are you taking a break from playing games?"
YOOSUNG,What do you mean games…
YOOSUNG,You read my messages.
YOOSUNG,I’m quitting LOLOL.
MC,"Yoosung, it’s a good evening~"
YOOSUNG,Good evening!!
YOOSUNG,I haven’t played LOLOL this afternoon and I feel very refreshed.
YOOSUNG,Yes. It’s time to delete my account.
YOOSUNG,My dark circles are gone ^^
YOOSUNG,From the coffee club to studying for TOEIC.
YOOSUNG,My life has turned upside down
YOOSUNG,in a single day.
YOOSUNG,I’m gonna log into LOLOL and delete my characters.
MC,Good luck..^^
YOOSUNG,Yup! Thank you!
MC,We’ll see…^^
YOOSUNG,I’ll prove to you how determined I am!
ZEN,lolol Yoosung.
ZEN,Do you really think you can quit overnight?
MC,"I support you, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,Thank you!
ZEN,lolol we’ll see~
JAEHEE,We’ll see.
MC,Yeah lolololol don’t think it’s possible.
ZEN,lololol The result is obvious.
JAEHEE,I agree.
YOOSUNG,Omg…
YOOSUNG,Heya Zen.
YOOSUNG,"Jaehee, you’re here too."
JAEHEE,Hello.
MC,It’s crowded here~
JAEHEE,Yes it is.
MC,Hey hey everyone.
YOOSUNG,Hey hey.
JAEHEE,;;
ZEN,"lolol Hey, MC."
ZEN,Yoosung..
ZEN,It’ll be different if you log in tonight ^^
JAEHEE,How can you say that when he just decided to quit games…
JAEHEE,"Since he won’t have a girlfriend anyways,"
JAEHEE,won’t it be better for him to play games?
MC,lolol Stop teasing him.
YOOSUNG,Yeah T_T
ZEN,It’s fun teasing Yoosung.
JAEHEE,I am not teasing.
YOOSUNG,Omg.
MC,You’re never gonna get a girlfriend so just enjoy life.
ZEN,lmfaoooooooooo So funny.
JAEHEE,^^
YOOSUNG,Omg.
YOOSUNG,You two are too mean!
YOOSUNG,Don’t pull MC into it too..
YOOSUNG,"MC, I’m leaving."
YOOSUNG,I’m not gonna say bye to Jaehee and Zen. Hmph.
JAEHEE,Do you think Yoosung will really change?
ZEN,No way that’s gonna happen lol
JAEHEE,I’m only flustered that he’s changed so much in half a day.
ZEN,lol I agree.
ZEN,It’s so cute to see Yoosung get angry.
JAEHEE,"I don’t know if he’s cute, but I did feel a bit of pleasure."
MC,lololol I enjoy teasing Yoosung too.
ZEN,lololol
ZEN,Women are worse these days.
MC,"Jaehee, you’re not…"
JAEHEE,??
JAEHEE,"No, I’m not."
ZEN,What did you think the question was?
JAEHEE,I don’t know but my answer is no.
ZEN,Hmm?
ZEN,"Right, MC."
ZEN,I told you about the model agency right?
ZEN,They’re asking me to wear Hanbok for a photoshoot.
ZEN,So I looked into what company was going to use the photos…
ZEN,And it’s an organization called Drop the Beat~…
ZEN,It’s a pretty big music label that produces traditional Korean music.
ZEN,Was wondering if you’d be interested.
JAEHEE,I think it won’t be bad to invite them.
ZEN,Right?
MC,Hmm. Don’t think they’ll fit with the party theme ^^;
ZEN,"Yeah? If you think so, then okay."
MC,Invite them to the party.
ZEN,Then I’ll tell them to reach you.
ZEN,I’m glad to help lol
ZEN,Haha.
ZEN,"Jaehee, how are you doing?"
JAEHEE,I’d like to say I’m well but I can’t.
JAEHEE,When do you think Mr. Han will take Elizabeth back…?
ZEN,He still hasn’t taken her back?
MC,I guess cat’s are pretty time consuming.
ZEN,I really… do not hate cats… but I don’t want one.
ZEN,Just thinking about that fur ball being beside me… ugh…
JAEHEE,I remember. The last time you were with Elizabeth…
JAEHEE,You suffered.
ZEN,I don’t want to remember it…
MC,Jumin must be busy with his schedule.
JAEHEE,I assume so.
ZEN,Hmph. No use worrying about him.
ZEN,He’s probably in his limo.
JAEHEE,"Limousines attract attention, so he takes a large van instead."
ZEN,That’s the same thing.
MC,"It must be hard, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,I thought it would be okay since it’s only for half a day…
JAEHEE,But he is late as usual.
JAEHEE,My suit is covered in white hair.
ZEN,Horrible just thinking about it.
JAEHEE,He said he’d come back this evening. Why hasn’t he?
ZEN,This dude thinks money can solve everything so he doesn’t have to keep his word.
JAEHEE,You are correct.
MC,Don’t be like that to Jumin.
ZEN,Omg.
ZEN,Why are you taking his side?
JAEHEE,I should have been more careful about my words… I apologize.
ZEN,Hmm~.
MC,Jaehee… I guess it’s been really tough?
ZEN,lololol Yeah…
ZEN,She must have been really upset.
ZEN,Oh.
ZEN,I have to take this call.
ZEN,"MC, talk to you later."
JAEHEE,I have to go take care of the cat. She’s loud in the living room.
MC,"Zen, talk to you later ^^"
ZEN,Yup. Later!
JAEHEE,Good bye…
MC,"Jaehee, good luck~!"
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,Then bye.
MC,"Jaehee, he still hasn’t picked up the cat?"
JAEHEE,Not yet.
V,I’m sure it’s tough.
MC,Oh! It’s V.
V,"Hello, MC."
JAEHEE,"Hello, V."
V,"Hello, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,You’ve been coming here more often the past few days…
JAEHEE,I assume you are less busy.
V,Haha.
V,I’m not that busy.
JAEHEE,"You came this afternoon, yes?"
V,Yes.
V,After what Yoosung said
V,I tried to put in more care but…
V,"I must leave on a business trip, so it will be difficult to come in here often."
MC,I want to know what you do exactly.
V,I don’t do much.
JAEHEE,You are still humble as usual.
JAEHEE,I read in the magazine that your last exhibition was a huge success…
MC,Exhibition?
JAEHEE,"He is not well known to the public, but he has created many great works"
JAEHEE,and he is very renown in the industry.
MC,Are you a painter?
V,No. I am not very talented at painting.
JAEHEE,He is a photographer.
JAEHEE,I don’t know if you heard before
JAEHEE,but V takes photographs.
MC,I think he’s rich.
JAEHEE,I don’t know the intention behind those words…
JAEHEE,but considering the auction bids for his photographs
JAEHEE,I assume he is very wealthy.
V,I’m not as wealthy as Jumin.
JAEHEE,That is because Mr. Han owns several businesses.
MC,So cool~!
JAEHEE,Yes. V’s photographs are very beautiful.
JAEHEE,Although I have only seen a few.
V,"Thank you, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,"V’s photographs are often in magazines and books, but whenever he has solo exhibitions, I know that thousands of people gather from all over the country."
JAEHEE,Mr. Han has told me all photos are sold the first day.
V,"Haha, I still have a long way to go."
V,But thank you for saying that.
JAEHEE,I had a question to ask you. May I?
V,Of course.
JAEHEE,"At our last party, auctioning off your photographs created a lot of attention"
JAEHEE,and I wanted to ask if that would be possible again.
V,If only my photographs can be put to good use
V,I will donate as many as I can.
JAEHEE,I’m glad to hear that.
MC,"Thank you, V!"
V,"I’m honored to be of help, MC."
JAEHEE,I thought we did not have enough time to bring attention to the party
JAEHEE,"but with your photographs, people will gather from all around the country."
V,You are too kind.
V,I haven’t been working very much recently
V,so I’m not sure if I can be much help… I’m a bit nervous.
JAEHEE,I’m sure you will be of great help.
JAEHEE,If the party date is set…
JAEHEE,I take it that MC is safe?
MC,Did I do something?
JAEHEE,That is not what I mean…
MC,I am safe.
JAEHEE,That is not what I mean…
JAEHEE,I meant that you are safe to us.
JAEHEE,I apologize if I offended you.
MC,What do you mean I’m not safe?
JAEHEE,"Until a couple of days ago, you were a complete stranger."
JAEHEE,Members of RFA such as Mr. Han or Zen are sensitive to society’s impression of them.
JAEHEE,"Because this is where their private lives are shared, it is natural that all members must be reliable."
JAEHEE,I hope you understand.
MC,"If you weren’t going to trust me, you shouldn’t have accepted me as a member in the first place."
JAEHEE,That’s…
V,"What’s important now is that you are one of us, MC."
V,I apologize if this offended you.
JAEHEE,I…
MC,Hmm… I understand.
JAEHEE,"Thank you, MC."
JAEHEE,I only thought that V would have verified that MC is not a threat to us before setting a date.
JAEHEE,Didn’t we all accept MC very suddenly because of our trust in you?
JAEHEE,Although Luciel checked on MC on the very first day…
JAEHEE,I assumed that you would have checked once more.
V,You are right.
V,"I’m sorry, MC… but we had to verify once more to see if you are not dangerous."
V,"Normally, we would have taken time to inspect before accepting a new member"
V,"but because you were an exceptional case, we had to do it afterwards."
JAEHEE,If MC has been verified once more… then she is completely safe to us.
V,Yes.
V,Luciel and I checked before setting the date.
V,Although we didn’t tell Yoosung.
MC,You could have just asked me what you wanted to know…
V,We weren’t suspicious enough to bother you.
V,Since the important things to find out are the person or group that led you there.
MC,"You do trust me, right?"
V,I do not think trust is the issue.
V,"My responsibility and duty is to make sure that even if you make a mistake, I can take care of it."
JAEHEE,"MC, please don’t take this the wrong way."
V,I hope this answers your question.
JAEHEE,"I always trust that you make the best decisions, V."
V,"Jaehee, thank you for believing in me."
MC,I’ll have to wait and see.
JAEHEE,"Yes, of course you should."
JAEHEE,It’s natural for you to be wary of us since you haven’t known us long.
V,"Besides, since I just said I did a background check on you,"
V,of course you are suspicious.
MC,"I trust you too, V."
V,Thank you for saying that.
V,Especially after I did a background check on you.
JAEHEE,"MC, you are not… wary enough."
V,My only hope is that I can be helpful…
JAEHEE,For me anyways…
JAEHEE,"Anyone who Mr. Han trusts, I must trust as well."
MC,I’m amazed that you trust V so wholeheartedly.
V,Since I’m her boss’ friend. I assume she has to be nice to me. Haha…
JAEHEE,That is not the only reason but… I cannot deny it.
JAEHEE,"When Rika was alive, she worked with V so…"
JAEHEE,I have seen with my own eyes how sincere and generous he is.
MC,Is V close with Mr. Han?
JAEHEE,Yes… I know them to be childhood friends.
V,We are.
V,We grew up in the same neighborhood.
MC,Then you two must have been close haha
V,Yes…
V,Since he was the only person I could talk to when I was little.
V,I want to talk to Jumin but he’s not here.
JAEHEE,He hasn’t come back from his business trip so he can’t read it.
V,He’s still busy.
V,"Jaehee, thanks to you, our last party had a lot more guests."
V,Please put care into it again.
JAEHEE,I’m only grateful for the opportunity.
V,"I thank you too, MC."
V,Since you are basically doing this organization a big favor.
MC,I should be the one grateful for the opportunity.
V,Thank you for thinking so.
JAEHEE,"You are very polite, MC."
MC,"Everyone has been helping me, so I’m not worried."
JAEHEE,MC…
V,I am very lucky.
V,To have someone this nice join our organization.
V,Thank you for the talk. I must leave now.
V,I’ll be on a business trip for a couple of days.
V,I will return before the party.
MC,Have a good trip~
V,"Thank you, MC."
V,I will return as soon as possible.
V,I will hear from Luciel if anything important happens.
JAEHEE,You always have. Alright.
JAEHEE,"Wherever you are, take care of yourself."
V,Thank you. Tell Jumin I said hi.
JAEHEE,"Yes, I will."
V,"And to Zen and Yoosung… And MC, please be well."
MC,Yes. Have a safe trip.
V,I’ll get going.
V,Good luck.
JAEHEE,He’s gone.
JAEHEE,Weren’t you flustered to suddenly talk to V?
MC,I can’t really figure him out.
JAEHEE,You can feel that way.
JAEHEE,He used to be different
JAEHEE,but these days I get the feeling that he may be hiding something.
JAEHEE,Although he would never…
MC,I’m fine~.
JAEHEE,You must have a very good personality.
JAEHEE,V is very kind but…
JAEHEE,"ever since Rika passed away, he’s become more curt"
JAEHEE,He is still grieving so please understand.
MC,"Yes, thank you for explaining, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,^^
JAEHEE,Tell me whenever if you need my help.
JAEHEE,Oh. Mr. Han is calling me.
JAEHEE,I’ll have to leave.
MC,Yes. Good luck ^^
JAEHEE,Thank you for the encouragement.
JAEHEE,Then good bye.
MC,"Zen, V was here."
ZEN,Yeah he was.
MC,It’s getting late…
ZEN,Yup… I’m getting more sentimental.
ZEN,Ugh. I should have come earlier… I could have talked to V.
ZEN,I’m sad I couldn’t say hi.
ZEN,He talked as if he won’t come here for a while.
ZEN,Hmm.
ZEN,"Yoosung that boy, he’s usually here around this time. Where is he?"
ZEN,Is he off to play games…?
MC,I think he’s playing games lol
ZEN,lol I think so too.
MC,He said he’s quitting.
ZEN,He did say that…
ZEN,"MC, do you think he’ll quit?"
MC,How dare he escape the evil plans of LOLOL so easily.
ZEN,lololol
ZEN,I think so too.
MC,I think he’ll pull it off.
ZEN,Hmm~
ZEN,We’ll see.
YOOSUNG,How could you not trust me!
YOOSUNG,I’m hurt…
MC,"Yoosung, hello~"
YOOSUNG,Hi☆
MC,Did you delete your game character?
YOOSUNG,Not yet…
YOOSUNG,Now I’m going
YOOSUNG,to go delete the characters.
ZEN,Omg. Is he really saying good bye to games?
707,Yoosung.
MC,Seven’s suddenly here!
ZEN,I don’t feel so good about this.
707,The main character always comes last.
ZEN,Don’t say nonsense.
MC,"Oh, it’s Seven."
707,"Hey, MC!"
YOOSUNG,"Seven, you’re back from your cave."
707,"Hey, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,Oh right.
YOOSUNG,That disease you said I have this morning…
YOOSUNG,Man~!
ZEN,Rumors say that the supermarket
ZEN,saw profit rise today because of all the chocolate milk Yoosung bought.
MC,So good for them.
707,Wanna drink some chocolate milk.
YOOSUNG,"Ugh… Not you too, MC!"
707,"Yes, I understand u hating me ^^"
707,But thanks to that ur no longer playing games.
MC,"Yeah, you should thank Seven."
707,Yup. Thank me.
YOOSUNG,What do you mean! No.
MC,What kind of logic is that?
ZEN,Yeah…
ZEN,Don’t think it’s really because of Seven.
YOOSUNG,Yeah! Why is it thanks to you???
707,It is thanks to me.
707,Without that incident
707,Yoosung wouldn’t have drank all that chocolate milk
707,and the supermarket wouldn’t have seen profit go up
YOOSUNG,What’s with the supermarket;;
707,Yoosung wouldn’t have left a will…
YOOSUNG,I thought the grim reaper was going to come get me.
707,I wouldn’t have found out who broke my precious figurine
707,"No, actually never mind. This isn’t really important."
ZEN,I think that’s the most important?
YOOSUNG,Omg so petty
MC,So petty 222
ZEN,333
MC,It’s Yoosung’s fault then.
ZEN,"Hmm… If you think about it, you did give him the reason."
707,Ahem lol
ZEN,How did you end up breaking it?
YOOSUNG,He just left it on the floor. Of course I stepped on it.
707,"Anyways, you who broke my toy"
707,are forgiven!!
707,From a gloomy life!
707,"Without a girlfriend, without games…"
707,a clean life like a potato salad without mayo
707,a life like a worn out hoodie.
707,You have been saved from that life.
707,You were able to reach enlightenment.
ZEN,You’re not making any sense.
YOOSUNG,What are you saying;;;
YOOSUNG,Am I the only one who doesn’t understand this?
MC,I like guys like Yoosung.
YOOSUNG,"Omg. I feel good, just used the wrong emoji."
ZEN,…
ZEN,Wait.
ZEN,Are guys like Yoosung popular these days?
YOOSUNG,Anyways…
MC,I don’t understand either.
ZEN,No one understands what he says.
MC,"Yoosung, be enlightened."
707,Yeah! be enlightened!!
YOOSUNG,"What’s wrong, MC T_T"
YOOSUNG,Do you think I really live like a worn out hoodie?
YOOSUNG,No! I’m living a happy and fulfilling life!
ZEN,lololol
YOOSUNG,I have no idea what Seven is saying.
707,You don’t believe in God so you’ll never understand.
YOOSUNG,I don’t believe that you believe either.
YOOSUNG,I’ve never seen you pray;;
707,Proof
MC,Photo of a hypocrite.
ZEN,Yup;;
YOOSUNG,Can’t understand.
MC,Just looking at it cleanses my soul★
YOOSUNG,What do you mean cleanse!
ZEN,MC… Did you eat something that Seven sent you?
707,"Nah, never did that."
YOOSUNG,Why are you dressed like a nun!?
707,To express my devotion to God.
707,Like a virgin….
MC,lmfaoooooooooo
YOOSUNG,roflololololololololol
YOOSUNG,The cat would laugh while sleeping.
MC,Seven…. I knew you were pure and charming.
YOOSUNG,?!?!?!
707,Haha…. I’m blushing >_<
ZEN,lmfaoooooooo
ZEN,This is the funniest joke I’ve heard in a while lololol
707,Even if I become a laughing stock…
707,"I’ve made Yoosung quit games, I’m happy with that."
YOOSUNG,I didn’t quit because of you.
707,U would say this.
707,“Don’t let your right hand know what your left hand is doing.”
ZEN,Isn’t it the other way around?
707,The moment u reach enlightenment
707,u will forever be grateful.
YOOSUNG,Grateful for what!
YOOSUNG,I said I didn’t quit games because of you~!
YOOSUNG,It was my decision!
707,The day u realize that it’s all thanks to me
707,u’ll realize I have the heart of a parent.
ZEN,You’ve just insulted parents all around the world.
YOOSUNG,Whatever…
YOOSUNG,I’m gonna go play games…
YOOSUNG,I’m going to defy your logic.
MC,Yeah. Don’t follow Seven.
YOOSUNG,I’m gonna start games again!
YOOSUNG,"If my life’s already a potato salad without mayo, then I should at least have soy sauce!"
ZEN,That sounds so sad.
MC,Yoosung… Don’t fall for Seven’s trick! It’s a trap!
707,…Said the devil.
707,No. Should I say said the angel.
YOOSUNG,MC…. Thank you for worrying about me.
YOOSUNG,But I don’t want to end up like Seven said!
707,Oh my oh my
707,You’re playing games again?
707,So my prayers didn’t work!?!?!?
ZEN,Oh my oh my? He’s crazy;
707,Don’t log on~ Darling~
707,I tried to hard.
YOOSUNG,Don’t care.
YOOSUNG,I’m going in.
707,Don’t play games.
707,I’m so sad T_T
YOOSUNG,Hmph.
MC,"To be honest, I did expect him to start again."
ZEN,"Ya, I did expect it too."
MC,So now we return to base one.
707,Amen.
ZEN,-_-
707,"Anyways, hope Yoosung climbs up fast ^^"
ZEN,You’re taking it out all on Yoosung.
JUMIN,Me revoila!
MC,"I thought you went to another city, not France; What’s with the French?"
JUMIN,How narrow-minded of you to think you have to go to France to use the language.
ZEN,Stop being pretentious.
JUMIN,"If people like me don’t exist, who are the snobs supposed to look up to?"
ZEN,What’s he saying.
MC,Bienvenue!
JUMIN,Haha.
JUMIN,I came back from a photo shoot.
JUMIN,My father dragged me there but I came back by myself.
ZEN,Did you drive? Are you crazy?
JUMIN,No. The driver drove.
JUMIN,That’s why I’m still alive.
ZEN,Why all this fuss when you’re not even a model.
707,Hey hey Jumin.
707,Welcome yo.
JUMIN,The How to Get Rich magazine wanted to take photos of me being leisurely at the beach.
ZEN,You’re ignoring Seven.
MC,How pretentious.
ZEN,Agreed.
JUMIN,Haha.
JUMIN,I understand that’s how you express your jealousy.
MC,So cool…!
JUMIN,Really? Thanks for saying so.
JUMIN,I wasted two hours of my precious time for that shoot.
ZEN,Damn pretentious.
707,Woof woof.
ZEN,"Actors work so hard to get their picture taken,"
ZEN,but you get your own pretentious photo shoot at a beach just because you’re rich
ZEN,and the photos go straight to the magazine.
JUMIN,"Handsome actors are common, but the world knows that naturally handsome corporate heirs aren’t."
JUMIN,Are you being jealous?
ZEN,No;
MC,"Zen, you have your own charms."
707,Ya. Ur attractive.
ZEN,That’s true…
ZEN,Thanks for recognizing it. ^^
707,Sometimes I seriously wonder
707,who’s the worst narcissist.
JUMIN,Haha. I don’t get fan letters like you do.
ZEN,Well.. That’s true.
JUMIN,I only get checks.
707,Wow! Gimme one lol
ZEN,That jerk.
JUMIN,Haha… Hope my Elizabeth 3rd is well.
JUMIN,I’m love sick.
MC,The cat’s so lucky~
JUMIN,I understand the jealousy.
JUMIN,She’s receiving all my love.
ZEN,"Yeah, that’s so awesome -_-"
MC,Hurry and take her. Jaehee had a rough time.
707,"wow. MC, you and Jaehee must be close."
ZEN,He was a bit too harsh to Jaehee.
ZEN,I’d rather go to prison than be with a cat.
JUMIN,Hmm.
JUMIN,"Anyways, I’ll go get her now."
MC,I can’t understand how you can like cats that much.
ZEN,"I agree, MC."
ZEN,Just thinking about cats give me pain.
707,Why~! I love cats.
707,I want to see Elizabeth too.
JUMIN,Get lost.
707,"To express my love towards Elizabeth,"
707,"I joined People Affectionate Towards Cats, aka, PATS."
JUMIN,Don’t ruin it and quit.
707,I’m going to be such an active member ^^
MC,Should I invite them to the party?
JUMIN,I don’t approve.
707,"I’ll tell them to contact u, MC^^"
JUMIN,I said I don’t approve.
ZEN,Sorry but not your choice. lol
MC,"Seven, you must like cats too."
707,I love~ cats.
JUMIN,Don’t love them.
ZEN,I understand why none of us have girlfriends.
ZEN,I’m dating my job.
ZEN,"that trust fund kid is dating his cat,"
ZEN,"Seven’s a freak,"
ZEN,and Yoosung’s addicted to games.
ZEN,No wonder we don’t have anyone.
707,Then everyone will be surprised if MC and I started dating ^^
MC,-_-
ZEN,You can get angry.
MC,Good idea.
707,Wow!
ZEN,You’re joking.
ZEN,The two of you dating.
ZEN,is less likely than Mr. Trust Fund Kid working at a convenience store.
JUMIN,Less likely than Zen getting a girlfriend.
ZEN,What?
MC,No way I’ll date Seven lol
707,Shocked
ZEN,What do you mean you’re shocked. Of course.
ZEN,MC’s a normal person.
MC,What’s wrong with dating Seven?
ZEN,!?
JUMIN,"So as the saying goes, everyone does have a match."
707,Should I…
707,prepare myself? lol
707,At least I’m not childish like u all.
ZEN,What are you talking about…
ZEN,You don’t deserve to say that!
707,^^
JUMIN,How classless.
JUMIN,I’m going to get Elizabeth. Adios.
ZEN,He was childish too;;
707,"Since I’ve relieved my stress from work, I’m gonna go sleep."
MC,"Bye, 707."
707,Bye~^^
MC,"Zen, are you going to stay here?"
ZEN,I’d like to…
ZEN,but I have to leave.
707,Out >_<
ZEN,So childish;;
ZEN,I have to go work out.
ZEN,"Don’t sleep too late, MC."
MC,"Let’s talk again, Zen ^^"
ZEN,Let’s ^^
ZEN,See you ^^
MC,"Yoosung, how does it feel to be back on LOLOL?"
YOOSUNG,"I’m in big trouble, MC…"
MC,"Jaehee, did Jumin take his cat?"
JAEHEE,^^
JAEHEE,I am finally free.
YOOSUNG,…What do I do?
JAEHEE,What is wrong?
YOOSUNG,I became a guild leader.
YOOSUNG,Do I deserve it?
MC,I think someone made a fuss about quitting games earlier…
JAEHEE,You’ve kicked your credibility to space.
YOOSUNG,That’s not what’s important right now T_T
MC,Wow~! So awesome.
YOOSUNG,I’m feeling so energized to hear you say that!!
MC,I think you more than deserve it?
JAEHEE,I agree.
YOOSUNG,Really!?
JAEHEE,"Seeing that you invest a quarter of your day there, I think you definitely deserve it."
YOOSUNG,Re…really!?
JAEHEE,Then I have to go clean now;;
MC,"Have courage, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,I will… have courage!!!
MC,"Go ahead, Jaehee~"
JAEHEE,"Yes, good bye."
YOOSUNG,I’ll try hard!!
MC,Hope you become a legendary guild leader.
YOOSUNG,I will take that to heart.
MC,LOLOL guild… How about inviting them to the party?
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,That’s not a bad idea!
YOOSUNG,They’re the best guild in LOLOL right now!
YOOSUNG,We have several professional gamers too!
YOOSUNG,I’ll contact them~!
YOOSUNG,Then… I’ll go be loyal to my guild!
ZEN,Seven has completely destroyed that young man.
MC,Hello~.
ZEN,"Oh, hey MC."
ZEN,I… fell asleep while working out just now.
ZEN,But my dream was so weird I can’t forget about it.
MC,"Zen, how was your work out?"
ZEN,I was taking a break in between and I dozed off…
ZEN,I…had a strange dream.
ZEN,Can I ask you a weird question?
ZEN,Do you have fun reading our conversations?
MC,I have fun.
ZEN,"Okay, then I’m glad."
MC,Why are you asking me that?
ZEN,So;;
ZEN,In the dream I just had…
ZEN,you were an imaginary person.
ZEN,It was convincing because…
ZEN,we’ve never seen your face or heard your voice.
ZEN,The thought that you might be a robot saying programmed things crossed my mind.
ZEN,Maybe Seven’s just tricking all of us?
ZEN,Maybe he’s trying to confuse us by creating an imaginary person called MC…?
MC,"To be honest, I’m using an loo that only lets me say programmed things."
ZEN,"What, what’s wrong… You’re scaring me lol"
MC,This is creepy…
ZEN,Right? I got goosebumps.
MC,You can’t trust me…?
ZEN,No… It’s not that.
ZEN,It’s just because of the dream.
ZEN,But what was more flustering was
ZEN,at the end of my dream…
ZEN,"It turned out that except you,"
ZEN,all of us were robots saying programmed things.
ZEN,lolololol
MC,You’re scaring me T_T
ZEN,Sorry…
ZEN,This is what happens when I watch a horror movie.
MC,We might both be robots.
ZEN,Omg. That’s a better twist.
ZEN,You should write something with that lol
ZEN,"Of course, it has to be horror!"
ZEN,Sorry for saying weird things.
ZEN,My dream was just so weird…
ZEN,As soon as I woke up I felt as if someone was watching me.
ZEN,I think I’m just overreacting.
ZEN,I should just shake it off and go to bed.
MC,Talk to you tomorrow ^^
ZEN,Yup. ^^
MC,Good night.
Rika,Do you believe in the afterworld?
Rika,"This is what V and I believe. Well, it’s actually more like I believe what V thinks… It’s a bit different from what my religion tells me."
Rika,When my body dies… my soul becomes free and can go anywhere. It can go across dimensions to a world where anything is possible.
Rika,"What should I call that place. Heaven… maybe? And.. when I go to heaven, I can meet other should that have lived with me, and visit my friends on Earth."
Rika,"But… because there is no body, the souls can’t feel or touch each other. My friends on Earth won’t be able to feel or touch me either."
Rika,"So when you meet another soul in heaven and fall in love, it becomes painful. So they make a promise to each other."
Rika,…To have a body on Earth and experience love together.
Rika,V and I… might have been two souls that met in heaven.
Rika,Because I feel it… It was fate…
YOOSUNG,MC!
YOOSUNG,Didn’t you hear a strange alarm?
MC,No I have’t.
YOOSUNG,Hmm;;
YOOSUNG,I guess it was just my phone…
MC,Heya Yoosung… I did see some weird messages!
YOOSUNG,Hello…!
YOOSUNG,Weird messages?
YOOSUNG,I didn’t see any…
YOOSUNG,I was just playing LOLOL
YOOSUNG,"but my phone rang so I came in,"
YOOSUNG,but nothing seems to be out of the ordinary.
MC,I’ll leave him a word for you ^^
YOOSUNG,Please do!
YOOSUNG,I was so surprised that I left without completing the quest.
YOOSUNG,My guild members are gonna hate me for disappearing like that…
YOOSUNG,Please tell him that I need him to check my messenger!
MC,It must be a bug… Seven’s not as good as he says he is.
YOOSUNG,Ugh.
YOOSUNG,Seven.
YOOSUNG,And he calls himself Seven Zero Seven the Great;;
YOOSUNG,I should ask him to check out my app then.
YOOSUNG,"I’m practically allergic to server maintenance,"
YOOSUNG,but I do know that it’s the only way to prevent problems.
YOOSUNG,"Then,"
YOOSUNG,Imma go back
YOOSUNG,to LOLOL.
MC,"Yoosung, turn off that computer and go to bed."
YOOSUNG,OMG!!!
YOOSUNG,I thought you were my mom for a sec;;
YOOSUNG,"Don’t do that to me, haha."
YOOSUNG,My mom’s gonna go ballistic if she finds out I game like this. lololol
YOOSUNG,See you!!
MC,You’re very quick. lol
YOOSUNG,I’m only being professional.
YOOSUNG,"If you’ve begun a quest, you have to see it to the end."
YOOSUNG,You have to be responsible about things like that. lol
YOOSUNG,"Anyways, I’ll be off!"
YOOSUNG,Good night!!
YOOSUNG,Laterz
707,Huh? Aarrgh!! Ms. Vanderwood!
707,Madam! Please put that taser away! That’s for torture.
Vanderwood,Don’t scream… You’re hurting my ears.
Vanderwood,And quit calling me madam.
707,Then Sir Vanderwood!
Vanderwood,…Stop joking around.
707,No.
Vanderwood,Do you want me to hit you?
707,No!
Vanderwood,Did you finish work?
707,No!
Vanderwood,Are you doing that on purpose?
707,No. But when did you come in? The gate question changes at midnight… You managed to come in!?
Vanderwood,I carry around an Arabic dictionary because of you… And don’t change the subject.
707,No.
Vanderwood,Oh. I guess you’re not afraid of my taser gun then.
707,"Alright alright. You’re the boss and I’m the servant, right?"
Vanderwood,Just answer my question. Why haven’t you finished work?
707,Because I didn’t work.
Vanderwood,…
Vanderwood,My arm is having a very hard time trying not to take out the taser gun.
707,Oh my god! I can’t believe I didn’t finish work! Oh no! What should I do??
Vanderwood,Is it because you got paid with potato chips last time? Your performances have been really bad after that.
Vanderwood,The boss told me that you haven’t been doing very well lately.
707,I said I don’t care since I like those chips. So the Honey Buddha Chips have nothing to do with my recent performances.
707,But… I do have a prediction report saying that I’ll do really well if I get compensated with cars. Do you want to see it?
Vanderwood,"Cars? If you get anything from an intelligence agency, you’re just going to be traced. I wouldn’t take it for the world."
707,"Oh, right. Cancel that."
Vanderwood,"Why don’t you ask them to give you a maid instead? Why is your house like this all the time? Empty soda cans, potato chip bags…"
Vanderwood,And why did you shred up all that paper? Do you have ADHD or something…? I can’t believe you manage to get work done here.
707,I was just about to say. My house is so dirty that I’m always distracted… The boss will understand once we give him a picture of my house.
Vanderwood,"Yeah yeah, what a great excuse. He’ll totally understand… Ugh! Your sofa smells like soda."
707,"It’s the lovely scent of Phd. Pepper. I get really focused once I drink it, but once I’m finished, it just makes my house more dirty."
707,"Since my house is like this, I can’t help but imagine decoding all the dust particles that fly around here… Huh…!? Decoding it in my imagination is making me hallucinate all the palm oil particles from the Honey Buddha Chips multiplying exponentially!"
707,"I want to eat them….! Oh, god… I see corn starch and honey particles floating around over there…!"
Vanderwood,"What the hell are you talking about, you weirdo…? Alright, I’ll clean up the house so just get back to work! You idiot."
707,An idiot…? Aren’t you being too harsh to a genius secret agent right now?
Vanderwood,"I barely stopped myself from calling you a cockroach. Since your house is always like this, I don’t know if I come here to keep an eye on you or be your maid."
707,"Alright, Vanderwood the 3rd… Sorry I treat you like a maid all the time. But will you first sweep the floor?"
Vanderwood,Are you kidding me?
707,"No. If you’re not going to clean, then I need to play a round of LOLOL. I’m serious."
Vanderwood,"What? God, seriously…"
707,Huh? What? But why dud my screen freeze…?
Vanderwood,How can you play games right now!?
707,Vanderwood… Come see this.
Vanderwood,"…Hey, I think you got hacked."
707,Me…? Hacked? This is… this is the RFA Messenger server…
Vanderwood,Turn on the log. Hurry!
JAEHEE,"MC, you’re here very late."
MC,"Jaehee, didn’t you see any weird messages in the chatroom?"
JAEHEE,Strange messages?
JAEHEE,"No, I only heard an obnoxious alarm noise."
JAEHEE,It seems that my messenger app also has a bug.
MC,"Jaehee, why are you still up?"
JAEHEE,I just finished work.
JAEHEE,I was just wrapping things up when I heard a strange alarm…
JAEHEE,I think my phone has the same bug that Yoosung has.
JAEHEE,Hmm…
JAEHEE,"Other than the fact that it made a strange alarm noise, I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary…"
MC,I don’t feel so good about it.
JAEHEE,Really?
JAEHEE,Then we must talk to Luciel as soon as possible.
MC,I hope it’s not anything serious…
JAEHEE,"It was only an alarm, so I doubt it’s anything grave."
JAEHEE,Oh.
JAEHEE,But I actually wanted to talk about this.
JAEHEE,Did you see what Luciel said last night…?
MC,You mean what he said about marrying me at a space station?
JAEHEE,What? ;;
JAEHEE,Did he say that?
JAEHEE,Well…
JAEHEE,"Congratulations, but…"
JAEHEE,"I have no intention to risk my life and take a rocket to go to a wedding,"
JAEHEE,so don’t bother to send me an invitation.
JAEHEE,"As soon as you two come back to Earth,"
JAEHEE,I will be waiting and ready to
JAEHEE,complain about why he dared to encourage Mr. Han ^^
JAEHEE,Seriously…
JAEHEE,what in the world did he begin…
MC,You mean about the cat business?
JAEHEE,How could he suggest another cat project to Mr. Han?
JAEHEE,"I mean, whine that cats can drink? haha…"
JAEHEE,Luciel…
JAEHEE,Just wait until you see what I do with you…
MC,The criminal is here.
707,"Seven is here, meow!!!"
JAEHEE,Hello.
JAEHEE,"Now, why don’t you give me your excuse on why you encourage Mr. Han to start another cat cusiness."
MC,The timing…
JAEHEE,Luciel.
JAEHEE,Hello ^^
JAEHEE,Are you ready to give your excuse
JAEHEE,on why you encouraged Mr. Han to start another cat business?
MC,Seven!! Run for your life!!
JAEHEE,He is already late.
JAEHEE,"Luciel, don’t you have something to say to me?"
707,Meow?
MC,Stop joking around…
JAEHEE,I agree.
JAEHEE,Did you think it wouldn’t matter since it’s not your job?
707,"That’s not it, meow!"
MC,It seems he cannot speak human.
707,Meow meow~
JAEHEE,So you’re a cat.
707,Ya.
JAEHEE,Shouldn’t cats that age be neutered?
707,I apologize.
707,I made a grave mistake.
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,You should have just stayed quiet.
JAEHEE,What in the world
707,This is trouble
707,There was a bug!?!!
MC,Don’t increase the font size like that;;;
707,Sry if i surprised u.
JAEHEE,"I hate that you’re changing the subject,"
JAEHEE,but please do something about the alarm bug;;
MC,"God Seven, where are you? Please save the world from all the bugs!!"
707,"The world is drowning in bugs as sleepless nights go by,"
707,"and rather than let the sensitive one, the cute one, and the game addict meet their downfall,"
707,it is time for me to come to the rescue.
JAEHEE,You talk as if you’re a superhero;;
JAEHEE,But isn’t it your fault that there is a bug in the first place?
707,But right now
707,it’s an
707,emergency!!!
MC,Are you ignoring what Jaehee said?
JAEHEE,I hope that’s not the case. ^^
707,Nah.
707,I respect everyone.
JAEHEE,"Then,"
JAEHEE,I must say this out of respect.
MC,"Everyone, move over!!"
707,"Yes, move over!!"
707,We must destroy our enemies!!
707,"Princess, I will be your knight in shining armor!!!"
JAEHEE,You two make a great couple…
JAEHEE,Luciel.
707,Ya?
JAEHEE,Stop being annoying and just fix the bug.
JAEHEE, And I will also have to ask why you mentioned another cat project to Mr. Han.
707,I have a good excuse for the bug.
707,In the industry we call internet cockroaches…
JAEHEE,Don’t change the subject.
707,The answer is
JAEHEE,I didn’t ask for the answer
707,HA
707,CKER
707,92$d@93@($
MC,Could you just get straight to the point?
707,Yes… Okay.
JAEHEE,God…
707,Someone hacked our messenger’s server.
MC,Hacker?? But you’re the hacker.
707,Exactly.
JAEHEE,Why are you suddenly talking about hackers?
707,In this great messenger
707,"that I, 707 the Great, invented"
707,was hacked!!!
JAEHEE,It was hacked around four days ago when MC came into RFA as well;;
707,You’re… right.
707,But we were hacked again last night.
JAEHEE,???
JAEHEE,What do you mean? ;;
MC,Don’t tell me… that alarm and messages were sent by a hacker?
707,I don’t have clear evidence yet
707,but I think that’s the case…
JAEHEE,Oh my god!
707,I couldn’t believe my eyes when I first saw the log!!
MC,How did you let this happen….?
707,"Ever since you came into RFA,"
707,I tightened the security;;
707,I was really shocked too T_T
JAEHEE,Oh my god…
JAEHEE,"You don’t think the messenger is being hacked right now too, do you?"
MC,Don’t tell me someone’s reading all our messages T_T
707,Nah.
707,Don’t worry. That’s not the case.
JAEHEE,I almost had a heart attack.
707,The person just disappeared after hacking in
707,and I think he’s hiding…
707,"There’s a record of him requesting a call on the messenger,"
707,so I think he sent an alarm or some type of message.
MC,I can’t trust this app then;
707,I can’t believe what’s happening.
JAEHEE,You shouldn’t be fainting.
JAEHEE,You should be fixing this;;
707,I’m getting up!!
707,Yes!!! You’re right!!
JAEHEE,Are you sure none of the information leaked?
707,Ya.
707,He didn’t even touch the database.
MC,It’s because of a hacker that I joined this group;;; I’m getting nervous;
707,I’m sorry for making you scared T_T
707,I’m actually worried about that too…
707,There’s a high possibility that it’s the same person.
JAEHEE,You’re right;;
MC,Do you think… the person has something to do with “Unknown”?
JAEHEE,I can’t help but think so.
707,We’ll have to see about that…
707,But they did happen within days one after another
707,so I’ll have to think they are somehow related.
JAEHEE,If someone managed to hack into our messenger once…
JAEHEE,Why not again?
707,"Ya. It makes so much sense that they’re the same person,"
707,but we don’t have any evidence!
JAEHEE,Hmm…
707,"After that happened, I tried to tighten the security"
707,"and moved the server far away so that no one can hack into it,"
707,but seeing that it did…
707,I doubt it just randomly hacked into our server;
707,It’s more likely that the hacker is after us for something;;
JAEHEE,You managed to sound very positive
JAEHEE,despite knowing this shocking information.
707,It’ll be more depressing if you sound depressing!!
MC,I can’t tell how serious this situation is because you’re so blaze about it.
JAEHEE,I can’t imagine Seven being serious.
707,Yup.
707,Turning on serious mode!!
JAEHEE,That sentence is just a paradox…;
MC,Yup. Let’s not be depressed and try to have a positive outlook on solving this.
707,Right you are!
JAEHEE,You two are very… positive…
JAEHEE,I suppose it’s good.
JAEHEE,I must contact Mr. Han.
707,I’m sorry that
707,I haven’t found anything yet T_T
707,"But since it’s very likely that the hacker is after us,"
707,do you think Jumin can share some of his security guards with us?
JAEHEE,You mean security guards for all the RFA members…?
707,I think it’s best
707,if everyone’s careful
707,since we don’t know what the hacker is after.
707,"About the hacker,"
707,I’ll look into it real hard
707,with my Supermaid Vanderwood.
JAEHEE,What??;;
JAEHEE,With Ms. Vanderwood?
MC,Show them what team play is all about!!
707,Don’t you worry!
707,I’ll prove to everyone that team play is always better than solo play!
JAEHEE,…With your maid!
707,The environment is important when on a mission!
707,"In that sense, of course I’m a team with Ms. Vanderwood"
707,who keeps the place clean!
JAEHEE,I see;;;;
JAEHEE,Her role is critical for this mission then.
MC,I thought she’s a maid?
JAEHEE,Exactly… How would Ms. Vanderwood help you?
707,Oh.
707,I just meant that Ms. Vanderwood would help me by keeping the place clean.
JAEHEE,Alright…….
JAEHEE,"Anyways,"
JAEHEE,I suppose I should tell Mr. Han to send everyone security guards?
707,"Yup, exactly."
JAEHEE,I will tell him as soon as it’s morning.
707,But what do we do about MC?
JAEHEE,Since her address is classified at the moment… we will not be able to send outsiders to her.
707,Ya.
MC,I think I’m the one in most danger right now…
707,Hmm…. Yes.
707,If you think about it
707,it’s most likely that the hacker is after the information stored in that apartment;;
JAEHEE,Right. Because it contains information on all our previous party guests.
MC,I… will have Seven’s blessing!!
707,I will bestow blessing on you… MC….
707,In the beginning God Seven created the heavens and the internet.
707,"And God Seven said, “Let there be light”, and there was light."
707,And then he bestowed blessing upon mankind made in his image.
707,Hurrah.
JAEHEE,Please be serious.
707,"If I’m serious about this,"
707,I would like to go there myself
707,to protect MC if possible….
JAEHEE,Oh…
JAEHEE,I suppose it’s possible since you know the address to the apartment.
707,Ya.
MC,Yay!!! God Seven!!
707,Oh.
707,My brain is starting to race
707,"at such a warm welcome, hahaha."
JAEHEE,You mean your heart.
707,Thank you but
707,I can’t go right away.
707,So sad..
MC,Don’t come.
JAEHEE,!?
707,T_T
JAEHEE,I didn’t expect that.
707,Oh.
707,"but,"
707,I’d rather be rejected.
707,"Right now,"
707,I’m busy working for the intelligence agency…
707,I have piles of work to go through…
707,Who knew I’d have to deal with a hacker!
JAEHEE,Then how will we secure MC’s safety?
707,There is a way.
707,I can keep an eye on the CCTV
707,I installed at the apartment
707,24/7 with
707,Ms. Vanderwood.
MC,"I feel like you spend too much time with Ms. Vanderwood, Seven. T_T"
707,I can’t help it!
707,It’s because of work!
JAEHEE,"But first, can you allow Ms. Vanderwood to watch the CCTV feed?"
JAEHEE,"If the address of the apartment is classified,"
JAEHEE,then the CCTV footage must also be classified as well.
707,Ya. The info won’t leak!
707,Ms. Vanderwood…
707,is in the same position as I am.
JAEHEE,???
MC,That’s not enough.
707,"Sorry,"
707,but there’s
707,nothing else
707,I can do right now T_T
707,I’ll never take my eyes off it!
707,So that you’re never in danger!
707,"Since we’re talking about it, I should set it up right now!"
707,"Jaehee, please tell Jumin about the guards."
707,I will be back ★
MC,Go.
707,I’ll try to take care of it asap!
MC,I’ll be waiting for you☆
707,OMG We’re reading each other’s minds.
JAEHEE,…You two are such a funny duo^^
JAEHEE,Ms. Vanderwood is his maid.
JAEHEE,Do you really think it’s alright for her to see everything?
MC,I’m a bit doubtful myself T_T I guess she’s not just any other maid.
JAEHEE,"Considering that she frequents Luciel’s house, I doubt she’s an ordinary person…"
JAEHEE,I’m starting to become curious of her as well.
MC,Think he’s just careless as always.
JAEHEE,Hmm…
JAEHEE,"Although Luciel loves to joke around,"
JAEHEE,he is always on point regarding his work…
JAEHEE,So I do not wish to be so harsh on him about this.
JAEHEE,Let’s just have faith that V and Luciel will take care of the situation…
JAEHEE,I only hope we find out who the hacker is as soon as possible.
JAEHEE,I will have to go contact Mr. Han now.
MC,Good bye.
JAEHEE,See you later.
JAEHEE,"It’s late in the night, but please get some sleep."
MC,Go ahead!
JAEHEE,"Yes, I will."
JAEHEE,"Please take care of yourself, especially considering the situation…"
JAEHEE,Then good bye.
ZEN,Good morning!
JUMIN,It’s a lovely morning.
ZEN,I take that back.
ZEN,A morning that starts with you can’t be good.
ZEN,"Oh… Of course, a morning with MC is a good morning indeed ^^"
JUMIN,You are being sexist.
JUMIN,A morning that starts with you…
JUMIN,That is giving me goosebumps.
JUMIN,When have we ever started the morning together?
ZEN,Never! Not even once!
ZEN,Don’t even imagine it;;;;
MC,Zen… Good morning.
ZEN,Slept well?
ZEN,Meeting the morning with a lady gets me excited…^^
ZEN,The only thing is….
MC,Anyways… Jumin ^^;; Good morning.
JUMIN,"Good morning, MC."
JUMIN,I hope you’ve had breakfast.
JUMIN,Eating regular meals is a shortcut to being healthy.
ZEN,I’d rather you learn the shortcut to being mentally healthy…;;
MC,Did you both have breakfast?
ZEN,I had a glass of juice!
JUMIN,"I had a good meal. Not enough to make me very full, but nutritiously balanced."
JUMIN,"If I eat too much for breakfast, my work schedule goes haywire."
ZEN,Aren’y you just going to talk about your cat projects at work;;??;
ZEN,I hate talking with Jumin from the morning.
ZEN,"If I just start the day with talking to you,"
ZEN,I’d feel so fresh.
JUMIN,You don’t respect her wishes.
JUMIN,Perhaps MC doesn’t want to speak to you.
ZEN,"Hey, don’t be ridiculous."
ZEN,No way she wouldn’t want to talk to a gentleman like me!
JUMIN,How arrogant of you.
JUMIN,Almost want to call you a…
MC,I like having Zen talk to me ^^;
ZEN,See? Look.
JUMIN,What’s the word I’m looking for….
ZEN,She says she likes me.
JUMIN,I think it’s a slang term…
ZEN,…
JUMIN,What was it…. It was do… dou….
ZEN,DOUCHE!
ZEN,It’s DOUCHE!!!! Are you still hung up on that?!
JUMIN,"Oh, yes."
ZEN,"God, you’re driving me insane."
JUMIN,I should make a note of that.
MC,God Seven…! I miss him… I guess he’s busy with work right? >.<
ZEN,"Well, he’s always busy with work. lol"
ZEN,But lady!
ZEN,You have prince charming right in front of you and yet you’re thinking of someone else…?
ZEN,That’s a bit sad.
JUMIN,I’m actually becoming sad too.
JUMIN,There’s a person in the 21st century calling himself prince charming.
MC,douche.
JUMIN,"Yes, that was it. Thank you."
ZEN,"With looks like mine,"
ZEN,I have every right to say that.
JUMIN,Then…. are you just assuming that MC only cares about looks?
ZEN,Don’t nitpick and just take it for what it is!!
JUMIN,No.
ZEN,Aaaarggh
ZEN,But according to
ZEN,"what Seven said,"
ZEN,the messenger was hacked
ZEN,and Yoosung and Jaehee’s phones rang…
JUMIN,I suppose. I received a call from Assistant Kang last night concerning the security.
ZEN,;;;;Yeah? So the situation is pretty bad?
ZEN,I can’t really tell
ZEN,because I was so deep in sleep that I didn’t hear anything…;
JUMIN,Me as well.
ZEN,…
JUMIN,···
MC,No way…
ZEN,No!
JUMIN,She didn’t say anything.
ZEN,Whatever!!
ZEN,You shut up.
JUMIN,I didn’t say much.
ZEN,Let’s change the subejyt
ZEN,"I mean, subject."
MC,You two must have been very tired.
ZEN,Gahhh!!
ZEN,Why do I hate the fact that I have something in common with that guy?!
JUMIN,I agree.
ZEN,Don’t even say that you agree right now!!
JUMIN,Ever since you talked about meeting the morning with me I haven’t been feeling very well.
ZEN,";;;So,"
ZEN,you’re giving us security guards?
JUMIN,Ya.
ZEN,"I mean, we’ll be fine, but how about MC?"
MC,I trust God Seven will protect me. lol
ZEN,But it’s not as if CCTVs can prevent all criminal activities.
JUMIN,Luciel said he’d keep an eye on her. She’ll be fine.
ZEN,"Seven, that dude…"
ZEN,Always going on about how good he is~
ZEN,and how he’s the smartest genius in the world~
ZEN,but his app got hacked twice in a row.
MC,I’m not fine;; I hope this gets taken care of asap.
ZEN,MC… I understand that you’re nervous.
ZEN,"you’re in a new environment,"
ZEN,and you don’t have anyone around you to be with you.
ZEN,I’d be having a breakdown right now!
JUMIN,You should have more faith in Luciel.
JUMIN,He’s always good at his job.
ZEN,That’s true.
JUMIN,Something else is getting to me.
ZEN,What?
JUMIN,He’s going to keep an eye on her with his maid?
JUMIN,Is that alright?
MC,Isn’t Seven sort of incompetent if he’s been hacked twice though…? ;;;
ZEN,Nah… He’s not.
ZEN,Nothing like this ever happened before you came along.
JUMIN,Whoever is attacking us can’t be your average hacker.
MC,Ms. Vanderwood…. I wonder who she is.
ZEN,;;Ya. Me too.
ZEN,Why do Seven and that weird maid with a fancy name
ZEN,get to see MC when I haven’y yet!!!
JUMIN,"That’s not the heart of the issue here,"
JUMIN,but it’s strange that he’s making his maid watch the feed.
ZEN,You don’t think
ZEN,"Seven’s actually close to his maid, do you? ;;"
ZEN,I thought he wasn’t supposed to have any friends…?
MC,I guess Seven’s not very social?
ZEN,It’s not a matter of his personality.
ZEN,It’s because of what he does.
ZEN,He has to deal with a lot of dangerous information
ZEN,so he once told us that
ZEN,we might get in danger by being too close to him.
MC,Why not? So what if he has a friend.
ZEN,He warned us before
ZEN,because of what he does for the intelligence agency…
ZEN,He told us not to be close to him since he’s dangerous;;
ZEN,Concerning what he does… I don’t think he can get that close to his maid.
JUMIN,You seem to be very interested in Luciel’s maid as well.
JUMIN,"If it bothers you that much, why don’t you simply ask him to set you two up for a date?"
MC,"If you have a thing for maids, then just say so."
JUMIN,Ya.
ZEN,Maid…
ZEN,"I mean, they’re not bad…."
JUMIN,So you have experience.
ZEN,No;;;
ZEN,That’s not it!!!
ZEN,I just want to know why he’s watching the CCTV feed with his maid when it concerns our security!
JUMIN,And that’s all?
ZEN,YES!!!
MC,I hate womanizers ^0^
ZEN,I’m not a womanizer.
ZEN,I’m just curious of her since
ZEN,she seems to be pretty close to Seven!
MC,"Zen… No way… It’s not that, right?"
ZEN,Of course it’s not!
JUMIN,Are you sure?
ZEN,Hey!!!
ZEN,I’m just curious
ZEN,of how Seven brought that maid into his house
ZEN,and became close enough to let her see the CCTV feed!!
JUMIN,Are you curious of what she looks like?
ZEN,Well yeah!!
ZEN,And you’re not?
ZEN,you jerk
JUMIN,"Sorry, sent the wrong photo."
ZEN,Don’t lie to me!!!
JUMIN,Alright. I won’t lie.
ZEN,!?!?!
ZEN,Jeez!!!
ZEN,"Anyways, hey!"
ZEN,I can take care of myself
ZEN,"so just send someone who’s lovely and delicate, not some big muscular dude!"
ZEN,For my aesthetic pleasure.
JUMIN,"If you only care about your aesthetic pleasure,"
JUMIN,I must send over a cat.
MC,I’d like to protect you Zen.
ZEN,"Oh my god, how can you be so cute! lolol"
ZEN,"But as a knight in shining armor,"
ZEN,I should be the one to protect the beautiful lady.
JUMIN,I see that you are mentally ill and confuse yourself as a prince and as a knight.
ZEN,-_- Hey
ZEN,And what about you!!!
MC,Please send over God Seven to me.
JUMIN,"He seems to want to go, but can’t because of his work."
ZEN,Ya;;
ZEN,But you two seem pretty close;;
JUMIN,I suddenly remember someone telling me that everyone has his or her soulmate.
ZEN,Ya… Me too. lolol
ZEN,I’m sure my soulmate is waiting for me somewhere out there~
ZEN,"Jumin, you have your cat so just live happily every after."
JUMIN,Thank you for your blessing.
ZEN,"And,"
ZEN,"for my body guard,"
MC,She’ll protect him meow~??
JUMIN,I will send her. Meow.
ZEN,"Dude, don’t say that."
ZEN,"MC, you can continue ^^ It suits you."
JUMIN,Meow.
ZEN,Oh god… My juice is coming back up again;;;
JUMIN,I like that response.
ZEN,Don’t even say the C in cats!!
JUMIN,"Come to think of it, I was thinking of creating wines that cats could drink…"
JUMIN,I should schedule a meeting with the winery owner…
JUMIN,But I have a meeting with Diamond Pharmaceuticals.
JUMIN,They tell me they produce pills for headaches in the shape of diamonds.
ZEN,Why the hell are you mentioning this?
JUMIN,For a good reason… They are a good potential guest for the party.
JUMIN,"MC, how about it? I’d be glad if my connections could help."
MC,Don’t feel like it.
JUMIN,Alright.
JUMIN,I’ll search for other guests.
ZEN,See! I told you it was pointless.
MC,They seem nice. Since everyone has headaches!
JUMIN,"Unlike somebody, MC has common sense."
ZEN,"That someone isn’t me, is it?"
JUMIN,I’ll tell them to rsvp.
JUMIN,And…
JUMIN,I will look into the cats that Zen requested.
ZEN,I did not request that.
ZEN,Are you serious right now?
JUMIN,Cats are very aesthetically pleasing.
JUMIN,I will come back after I’ve looked into it.
JUMIN,Then I’ll have to go to my meeting.
MC,Good luck on the meeting~!
JUMIN,Thanks.
JUMIN,I’ll come back with god results.
ZEN,Don’t come back if you can…
JUMIN,I will make sure to come back.
JUMIN,Then good bye.
MC,Have some mercy on Zen ^^;; Good bye~
JUMIN,"See you later, MC."
ZEN,Hey! Don’t even think about sending cats over to my place!!!
ZEN,He never freaking
ZEN,listens to what other people say…!!!!
ZEN,"Seriously, if he sends cats over…"
ZEN,I’m gonna!!!!
ZEN,Oh god
ZEN,I’m gonna!!!
ZEN,···
MC,Run away.
ZEN,Uh……. yeah…
ZEN,I’m gonna run away…
ZEN,Since I can’t even open my eyes
ZEN,when my allergy acts up…
MC,I’d like to protect you T_T
ZEN,"No matter how many strands of cat fur attack me,"
ZEN,"if I am in your arms,"
ZEN,perhaps the allergy won’t be able to defeat me…
ZEN,You never know though.
ZEN,It might defeat me….
ZEN,Oh… right!
ZEN,"Come to think of it, I have a meeting today too."
ZEN,Who was it with…? ;;;
ZEN,It was someone strange…
ZEN,Oh!
ZEN,It was some traditional music group.
ZEN,"I don’t know what they want from me,"
ZEN,but I’ll have to get ready.
MC,Hurry up and get ready.
ZEN,Ya.
ZEN,Don’t worry.
ZEN,I’m not just any other actor!
ZEN,Then bye!
MC,Perhaps because your looks are timeless?
ZEN,Haha.
ZEN,You think?
ZEN,I’m blushing.
ZEN,Timeless beauty… I’ll have to make sure I look good.
ZEN,"MC, see you later!"
JAEHEE,"I came to see whether there’s been any progress concerning the hacker,"
JAEHEE,but 707 isn’t here.
MC,Is Jumin at his meeting?
JAEHEE,Yes.
MC,Did you get to the office fine?
JAEHEE,"Yes, of course."
JAEHEE,I leave my house at least an hour early
JAEHEE,"in case of morning traffic and potential accidents,"
JAEHEE,so I always get to work early.
JAEHEE,I left more early today because of the meeting…^^
JAEHEE,"Once the meeting with the pharmaceutical company is over,"
JAEHEE,"I’m sure he’ll bring up the new project concerning wine for cats,"
JAEHEE,"so although it’s sudden, I scheduled a meeting for him with the oil prince."
JAEHEE,In the middle east. ^^
JAEHEE,It will be a meeting and business trip~
JAEHEE,…^^
MC,You did that on purpose…;;;
JAEHEE,It was not on purpose.
JAEHEE,I only thought that he should meet with the oil prince as soon as possible
JAEHEE,since the value of oil continues to fluctuate across the world.
JAEHEE,^^
MC,Wow! I’m sure that has nothing to do with the cat project… You just want to be prepared for fluctuating oil prices?
JAEHEE,"Oh my god, how do you understand me so well?"
JAEHEE,I do whatever I can for the company’s future.
JAEHEE,"So tragically, we will have to postpone the new cat project ^^"

JAEHEE,Please stop there ^^
707,dlkjg
707,eoipk
707,..
707,.
707,ok
JAEHEE,Have you found anything about the hacker?
MC,Could you please just get straight to the point?
JAEHEE,Yes.
JAEHEE,What is happening with the hacker?
707,Not yet…
707,I have so much work for the agency…!!
707,can’t focus…
707,Sorry MC T_T
MC,I guess you’re still caught up with the agency T_T Cheer up!
707,T_T
707,I will!
707,I’ll work harder
707,"just for you, MC!"
MC,Can’t you just do one thing at a time? You should quit one;
707,"I’d like to,"
707,but it’s not that easy to quit your job T_T
JAEHEE,I understand.
707,Oh.
JAEHEE,Since so many places like to take my money away.
707,That too…
707,"Anyways,"
707,I’ll take care of it
707,as fast as I can so just hang on a bit longer.
JAEHEE,Nothing’s wrong with MC for now then?
707,Nope.
707,I checked the CCTV
707,and nothing strange happening!!
707,I’ve been looking at it
707,every 2.35 seconds
707,just in case something happens.
JAEHEE,2.35 seconds?
707,Ya.
707,But just looking at the screen
707,makes me so frustrated…
MC,I knew it! I felt as if you were looking at me every 2.35 seconds!!!
707,"We even locked our eyes once, right?!"
707,You seemed to be going to the convenience store earlier.
JAEHEE,….Isn’t it a bit strange to communicate through CCTV?
MC,Are you a stalker or something? ;;
707,Nah.
707,It doesn’t count since I’m not physically there T_T
707,I want to go to MC and protect her myself!
707,Can’t believe there’s nothing I can do…!!!
MC,It’d be so great if you could come!
JAEHEE,"Unfortunately, Seven says he’s busy… What can you do."
707,Ya…
707,I can’t give you a body guard… and I can’t go...
MC,Don’t come.
707,Oh.
707,Uhm.
707,ok.
MC,"I’m just kidding, haha! I want you to be by my side."
707,Oh… haha
707,I wish I could go…
707,Sorry that I can’t T_T
MC,I’d prefer to be alone when I’m home.
707,Oh… me too!
707,"But for some reason,"
707,I feel a bit…
707,blue…
707,So…
707,I’d like to make a body guard robot for you…
707,But I guess that would take a long time. T_T
JAEHEE,you could simply finish your work for the agency and catch the hacker.
707,Body guard robot…
JAEHEE,"Or, go there yourself to protect her…"
707,Maybe you’d like that…
JAEHEE,;;;
MC,I love all robots♡
707,Ooh!
707,Me too!
JAEHEE,I see you two have managed to find another thing you both have in common;
707,Awesome.
MC,Aren’t you ignoring what Jaehee said? ;;
JAEHEE,Thank you for pointing that out.
JAEHEE,"Luciel,"
JAEHEE,Are you listening to me?
707,"To be honest, I was planning on creating a small watch dog just to test it out,"
JAEHEE,You are not listening to me.
707,I’m not confident enough to send it to ur place.
MC,This thing is supposed to protect me?
707,You don’t like it T_T
JAEHEE,"It does seem a bit too small to protect her,"
JAEHEE,but it does seem to have turned out nicely considering how much time you spent on it.
JAEHEE,"I don’t know how it will do as a watch dog, but it is cute."
MC,OMG~! SO KEWT~!!
707,really!?
707,I’m glad you like it lololol
JAEHEE,It is cute.
707,Ms. Vanderwood did tell me to just work
707,if I have the time for that….
JAEHEE,I completely agree with that…
JAEHEE,But it does seem to have turned out nicely. It’s very cute.
707,+_+
707,Right? It’s so cute!
707,So lovely~
707,So adorable~
JAEHEE,Yes… You could almost sell it.
707,It spits fire from its mouth. Do you think the government will approve? ^^
MC,Why did you create something so dangerous? ;;
707,For protection… that’s why I made it spit fire.
JAEHEE,"That small puppy doesn’t contain a gas tank, does it?"
707,"Haha, it does."
JAEHEE,^^
JAEHEE,You’ll go to jail for creating objects like that.
MC,Spitting fire balls of love… Cupid’s fire!!!
707,Fire!!
JAEHEE,"…No, I doubt you’d be able to sell it."
JAEHEE,You might actually go to jail for creating such a hazardous product. ^^
707,;;;
707,"But still, isn’t it pretty?"
707,I thought
707,it would be perfect for MC
707,while making it.
707,Since both of them are cute…!
MC,I don’t look like that.
707,"Of course, you’re not a robot!!!"
707,T_T
707,I’ll just take it that you don’t like the design…
707,Seven feeling depressed now…
MC,"God Seven, you’re way cuter ^^"
707,Haha.
707,You caught my cute side!
707,I feel like my great secret has been revealed;;;
JAEHEE,Okay…;;;
JAEHEE,Well;
JAEHEE,I’m jealous that you’re the only one who knows how MC looks like.
707,Haha…
707,B
707,U
707,T…
707,"Even if I make things like this,"
707,it won¡t help MC….
JAEHEE,Yup.
MC,"It does help! If only it didn’t spit fire, I would have wanted one!"
707,But that’s the main part…
707,And it also might explode because of the gas tank T_T
707,I should create a cute version that doesn’t spit out fire lolol
JAEHEE,Why don’t you simply work if you have the time?;;.
MC,Yes mte
707,mte too
JAEHEE,It would be more efficient for you to take care of your work in that time.
707,Yeah…
707,I should just work…
707,Why did I do that??
JAEHEE,Because sometimes you simply cannot work.
707,···
MC,Then just take a walk~! You should clear your head.
JAEHEE,I agree.
JAEHEE,People do say that you should take your time the more anxious you are.
707,The more anxious you are… smell your time.
707,okie dokie
MC,Nothing you can do about not being able to concentrate;
707,Is there no hope? T_T
JAEHEE,This is only my experience…
JAEHEE,"But at times like that, it helps to take a break."
JAEHEE,I recommend getting a treat or taking a walk.
707,A treat… Honey Buddha…
707,Too much Buddha…
JAEHEE,Then how about going out for a walk?
707,Ya.
707,I should;;
707,I’m gonna clear my head a bit
707,and come back.
MC,"Next time, come back after you’ve fixed everything."
707,Yup!
707,I’ll try…
MC,I’ll be waiting for you! Cheer up!
707,Yup!
707,I’ll be keeping an eye on you even while I’m taking a break
707,so don’t worry!
JAEHEE,…Is that really taking a break though?
707,It is.
707,See u later!
JAEHEE,Good bye.
JAEHEE,But…
JAEHEE,How did he manage to create that robot in just a few hours? ;;
JAEHEE,No one can deny that Seven is a genius.
MC,He should be tracing the hacker if he has time for that;;
JAEHEE,That’s true.
JAEHEE,But I doubt Luciel didn’t want to trace the hacker.
JAEHEE,The day simply hasn’t been working out for him.
MC,I love genius people!
JAEHEE,I think if he really puts his mind to it… he’ll create the body guard robot in a couple of days…;;
JAEHEE,"Besides, he made it just for you, MC…."
JAEHEE,He is being very kind.
JAEHEE,Luciel may seem quite ridiculous
JAEHEE,because he likes to joke around all the time
JAEHEE,but sometimes even I get surprised at what a genius he is.
JAEHEE,Oh.
JAEHEE,I’d like to talk more…
JAEHEE,but Mr. Han’s meeting will end soon.
JAEHEE,I must go.
JAEHEE,"Anyways… Please take care of yourself, MC."
MC,Hurry and go! I hope he doesn’t mention anything related to cats!
JAEHEE,You understand how I feel.
JAEHEE,Thank you.
MC,"I will! You be careful too, Jaehee!"
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,"And Luciel seems to have lost his concentration,"
JAEHEE,but he will come back to normal soon. ^^
JAEHEE,Good bye.
YOOSUNG,"Hey, MC!!"
MC,Did you get to school safe?
YOOSUNG,Yup!!
YOOSUNG,Got here safe and sound.
MC,Yoosung~ Did my ickle Yoosung baby have his lunch~?
YOOSUNG,Wow
YOOSUNG,I-I thought you were my mom….;;;
YOOSUNG,Uhm…..;;Haha;;;;;;
YOOSUNG,I’m eating right now...
YOOSUNG,"But,"
YOOSUNG,something really surprised me just now!
YOOSUNG,"It’s lunchtime right now,"
YOOSUNG,so I was just eating at the cafeteria
YOOSUNG,when suddenly
YOOSUNG,these really muscular men in black sunglasses
YOOSUNG,and suits came up behind me without a sound!
YOOSUNG,There were about five or six of them!
MC,That’s quite scary!
YOOSUNG,I was really scared too.
YOOSUNG,"But,"
MC,KIDNAPPERS!!!!!
YOOSUNG,lololol I thought so too so I tried to defend myself but
YOOSUNG,the tallest one suddenly asked
YOOSUNG,“Are you Yoosung Kim?”
YOOSUNG,in a super duper
YOOSUNG,low voice!
MC,Yoosung…. Your last name is Kim? I never knew lol
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,I told you when I first introduced myself.
YOOSUNG,Don’t forget from now on…
YOOSUNG,My name’s Yoosung Kim….
YOOSUNG,Anyways;;
MC,OMG~ So cool!
YOOSUNG,Hahaha.
YOOSUNG,I thought it was pretty cool too.
YOOSUNG,That suit and that voice! lolol
YOOSUNG,No one’s called my name like that
YOOSUNG,for a while now
YOOSUNG,"so I was really flustered,"
YOOSUNG,"but I managed to answer yes,"
YOOSUNG,and they told me they are body guards that Jumin sent…
YOOSUNG,They’ll be following me around 24/7 and trying their best to give me privacy.
YOOSUNG,"And because of security reasons, I’m going to be moving in a van now!!"
YOOSUNG,The van’s really fancy!!!
YOOSUNG,lololol
MC,So jealous… No one can come to me because of security reasons… T_T… I wish at least Seven could come.
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,Don’t worry too much!
YOOSUNG,"Seven says he’s watching,"
YOOSUNG,so I’m sure nothing will happen!
MC,"Ugh, you’re so bougie lol"
YOOSUNG,lolololol
YOOSUNG,"Now that this is happening,"
YOOSUNG,"tomorrow, I’m gonna start wearing sunglasses"
YOOSUNG,and care about how I look. lololol
YOOSUNG,I…
YOOSUNG,I think I’m going to be famous at my school now.
YOOSUNG,All my friends were asking about it. lololol
YOOSUNG,I really love
YOOSUNG,having body guards around me. lolol
YOOSUNG,I heard some vans have massage chair in them.
YOOSUNG,"You don’t think that’s the one I have, do you? lolol"
MC,You’re getting ahead of yourself. lol
YOOSUNG,"No,"
YOOSUNG,I’m not getting ahead of myself!
YOOSUNG,It could really happen lololol
MC,People will think you’re a movie star or something +_+
YOOSUNG,Do you think so…?lololol
YOOSUNG,Maybe I should have practiced giving autographs. lololol
YOOSUNG,I should create a new signature
YOOSUNG,that looks like a star in the sky. lolol
MC,"Little boy, you dream of such nonsense."
YOOSUNG,Nonsense…? T_T…
YOOSUNG,I wanted to be famous
YOOSUNG,for once in my life T_T
YOOSUNG,And dreams will become reality!! lolol
YOOSUNG,You don’t think they’ll come
YOOSUNG,"and ask for pictures, do you? lol"
YOOSUNG,"Oh,"
YOOSUNG,I almost forgot.
YOOSUNG,That puppy robot Seven made is soooo cute!
YOOSUNG,"If I were a girl and got that as a gift,"
YOOSUNG,I’d be so happy…^^
YOOSUNG,It’s so romantic.
MC,What do you mean it’s cute? ;; It’s practically a weapon.
YOOSUNG,But it’s for your protection…
YOOSUNG,I think that’s why he put that feature in.
YOOSUNG,"Anyways, he made it just for you!"
MC,I would want one if only it didn’t spit fire lolol Seven is so cute!
YOOSUNG,Ya.
YOOSUNG,The fact that it spits out fire is pretty dangerous
YOOSUNG,but there’s nothing better than a
YOOSUNG,"hand made gift, haha."
YOOSUNG,"I wish he’d gather up his courage and give it to you, haha."
YOOSUNG,"Besides,"
YOOSUNG,"the way I see it,"
YOOSUNG,the only reason why
YOOSUNG,Seven says he can’t focus
YOOSUNG,is because
YOOSUNG,he’s too worried about you!!
YOOSUNG,What do you think?
MC,I think he’s just ADHD.
YOOSUNG,You think? ;;;
YOOSUNG,But do you think he could have created that robot when he has ADHD? ;;;
YOOSUNG,No matter how much I think about it… I think Seven’s overly worried about you.
MC,He’d work so well if only I could go to his house!!
YOOSUNG,Oh~!! That’s good thinking!
YOOSUNG,"But you can’t more, right? T_T"
YOOSUNG,Something dangerous might happen if you leave….
YOOSUNG,"Anyways, I hope he takes a break and gets it together!!"
YOOSUNG,He has to catch that hacker dude for everyone’s safety! lol
YOOSUNG,"All I know is that my phone made a strange noise,"
YOOSUNG,and it’s not as if I can see what he looks like or anything
YOOSUNG,so I can’t really tell how serious the situation is…
YOOSUNG,But if I get to enjoy
YOOSUNG,"the life of the top 0,1% through this,"
YOOSUNG,"I’ll just have the time of my life,"
YOOSUNG,I have class now so I have to go. lol
MC,Enjoy it while you can lololol
YOOSUNG,I will!
YOOSUNG,"To be honest, I feel like they’ll come into the classroom with me. lololol"
YOOSUNG,I’m getting excited already!
MC,Have fun in class!
YOOSUNG,Okie!
YOOSUNG,"But,"
YOOSUNG,I hope the body guards don’t come into the classroom…
YOOSUNG,I can’t be too conspicuous ^^
YOOSUNG,Haha.
YOOSUNG,See you later!
JUMIN,"MC… And,"
JUMIN,"Assistant Kang, you’re here too."
JAEHEE,"Mr. Han, you succeeded in cutting another deal today."
MC,"You did well too, Jaehee!"
JAEHEE,It’s nothing. Mr. Han did everything. ^^
JAEHEE,But thank you for
JUMIN,"Right, I did everything."
JAEHEE,"…Yes, of course."
MC,So the meeting went well? Congratulations!
JAEHEE,The way you managed to convince them with those smooth words were admirable.
JAEHEE,Congratulations.
JUMIN,thx thx
JAEHEE,…;;
JUMIN,I’ve only done my job. No need to make a fuss out of it.
JUMIN,But
JUMIN,what is this about me leaving for the middle east tomorrow?
JUMIN,"Regardless of how the world is going, this is very sudden."
JAEHEE,I had no choice but to schedule this business trip.
JAEHEE,What can we do when oil prices are going through the roof?
JUMIN,That’s true…
MC,Oil prices are effecting the currency too… The global economy is always hard to figure out.
JAEHEE,You are definitely right.
JUMIN,"Nonetheless, isn’t it too sudden?"
JUMIN,I’d like to postpone it for next month…
MC,What a shame… I really looked forward to the new cat project ^^
JUMIN,Hmm…
JUMIN,I’d like to see some reports to see what I should prioritize…
JAEHEE,Mr. Han!!
JAEHEE,C&R will never forget all your efforts to better the company’s future!
JUMIN,What was the name of that prince?
JAEHEE,···
MC,Oil Prince.
JAEHEE,That’s the name he signs his emails with.
JUMIN,I remember his broken english.
JAEHEE,Yes… He is a very unique man.
MC,Arabica Trevor
JUMIN,Arabica Trevor.
JAEHEE,I’ll find the name. Let’s let that one go.
MC,Peter Petrol
JAEHEE,That doesn’t sound very convincing…
JUMIN,How about Oliver Oil?
JAEHEE,I think it’s a bit foolish to guess his name according to what he does.
JAEHEE,Just like your name isn’t Trustfundkid Han.
JUMIN,Wait… What did you just say?
JAEHEE,"Mr. Han, we have more important issues at hand."
JAEHEE,I will find his exact name before you leave and give you the report.
JAEHEE,"Oh, right!"
JAEHEE,And I had something to tell you.
JUMIN,?
JAEHEE,A body guard also came to me.
JUMIN,Of course. You’re a member of the RFA as well.
JAEHEE,I’m usually with you so I am protected regardless…
JAEHEE,"But,"
JAEHEE,"I was expecting someone muscular,"
JAEHEE,but someone tall and slender came.
JAEHEE,I first thought that he was a model.
JAEHEE,They all had small faces and broad shoulders. They all looked as if they just got off the runway.
JUMIN,You thought those handsome body guards were models…
JUMIN,I actually had a fairly good idea earlier.
JAEHEE,What is it?
JUMIN,I thought of it while looking at the puppy robot that Luciel created.
JAEHEE,?
JUMIN,Cat robots.
MC,Mr. Luciel is always open to financial cooperation.
JAEHEE,"MC, are you 707’s assistant?;;"
JUMIN,"Personally, I’d be glad to see the deal go through."
MC,"Jumin, you’re a genius."
JUMIN,"Seeing how fast he made it, the production process can’t be very complicated."
JUMIN,Why don’t we make a cat version and produce it?
JAEHEE,;;;
JUMIN,Just imagine it meowing every time it opens its mouth?
JAEHEE,I can’t imagine it.
JUMIN,I can actually. Elizabeth the 3rd will gave a little sister.
JUMIN,"If we work together, Luciel will produce a cute car robot in no time."
JAEHEE,Mr. Han
JUMIN,Yes?
JAEHEE,Have you checked your email?
JUMIN,I checked it just before.
JAEHEE,"After you hd your meeting with Diamond Pharmaceuticals, I had some time left so I sent you a list of presents that the oil prince might like."
JAEHEE,"If you are leaving tomorrow, you will have to decide right now."
JUMIN,Really? I didn’t see it before…
MC,"Jaeheen, aren’t you being too obvious? lololol"
JAEHEE,I have to live you know.
JUMIN,I understand.
JAEHEE,"Mr. Han,"
JAEHEE,there must have been an error ^^
JAEHEE,I will send it to you again so I’d appreciate it if you could check it.
MC,There’s not much time left!!
JUMIN,I see.
JAEHEE,"Yes, so please make the decision as soon as you can."
JAEHEE,I think you should check your email again.
JUMIN,I will.
JAEHEE,Then I must go.
MC,Good bye.
JAEHEE,"Yes, see you later!"
MC,Hurry and write that email.
JAEHEE,^^
JAEHEE,I will be faster than lightning.
JUMIN,Assistant Kang is very passionate about that meeting with the oil prince.
JUMIN,She’s very sensitive to oil prices… Is she planning to get a new car next year?
JUMIN,She did receive a bit of a pay raise.
MC,I want to work at your company too! Climbing up that promotion ladder~!
JUMIN,Really? I didn’t realize that you wanted to work in my company.
JUMIN,Anyone else would be very flustered to join RFA so suddenly…
JUMIN,"But seeing you prepare for the party without much trouble,"
JUMIN,you definitely do have talent.
MC,"Jaehee is very smart…. No, perhaps she is just desperate to live a proper life."
JUMIN,Father once told me
JUMIN,that just closing my eyes
JUMIN,at times like this
JUMIN,would help the business.
JUMIN,I must go check my email.
JUMIN,"Talk to you later, MC."
MC,"You’re leaving tomorrow, right? Hope you get ready without much trouble!"
JUMIN,Thank you.
JUMIN,I hope the hacker situation gets solved before I leave tomorrow…
JUMIN,"Then, please excuse me."
MC,"Yes, take your time ^^ For Jaehee."
JUMIN,I was about to email Luciel first anyways.
JUMIN,I really want to see a cat robot.
JUMIN,Then good bye.
ZEN,"Hey, MC!"
MC,Hello~
ZEN,"Hi,"
ZEN,"I’d like to say I’m doing fine,"
ZEN,but I’m not.
ZEN,;;;
MC,Zen~ Is the body guard with you?
ZEN,"Oh, about that…^^"
ZEN,"That’s why I came here,"
ZEN,"but Mr. Director isn’t here, I see…^^"
ZEN,Jumin Han…
ZEN,that bastard!!!
MC,Why are you being so mean to our Jumin? T_T
ZEN,MC…. Look at this first.
MC,Did something happen?
ZEN,Thanks for asking ^^
ZEN,Can you see it?
MC,Wow! They look so reliable!
ZEN,They are so reliable that even I’m getting scared!
ZEN,I keep on bumping into them!!!
ZEN,"I asked for a body guard, not a whole army;;;"
ZEN,But he sent me people with square bodies and marble muscles…
MC,Who is that man… I’m scared T_T
ZEN,I’m scared too…
ZEN,That jerk totally ignored what I said!!
ZEN,I said I wanted someone delicate who is aesthetically pleasing!
ZEN,He sent Jaehee a model
ZEN,so why did he send me an army of gym trainers?! T_T
ZEN,Isn’t he being so mean!?
ZEN,I have no intention to insult those who came to work
ZEN,"but that jerk did this on purpose just to mess with me, right?"
ZEN,One of them even used to be a wrestler.
ZEN,"I jokingly asked him to show me a move,"
ZEN,and he almost
ZEN,threw me down on the asphalt!!!
ZEN,The guy who sells goldfish-shaped bread laughed at me!!!
MC,You can’t joke about things like that T_T
ZEN,I just wanted to be friendly.
ZEN,These people are overly serious;;;
MC,I wish I could bring Seven goldfish-shaped bread since he’s working so hard…
ZEN,Why are you suddenly talking about Seven right now?
MC,I just laughed a bit too lololol
ZEN,Haha…
ZEN,I’m glad that I managed to
ZEN,make a lady laugh at this situation
ZEN,but I can’t forgive that jerk!!!
ZEN,"Oh god,"
ZEN,my reputation!!!
ZEN,Ugh….
ZEN,"Well, nothing will come out of getting mad."
ZEN,I came back from work with a lot on my mind already;;;
ZEN,"But thanks to that army of body guards standing in front of my door,"
ZEN,my life has gotten more complicated.
MC,"Oh, right! Did the meeting go well?"
ZEN,Thanks for asking.
ZEN,It was a bit tough today…
ZEN,I told you that I was meeting a group of traditional music players.
ZEN,"I wondered what they wanted from me,"
ZEN,but they’re asking me if they could take a photo of me in hanbok…
ZEN,They saw my photo on the internet by chance and they want me to be their model!
MC,What kind of thoughts?
ZEN,So the meeting I had today…
ZEN,I was expecting some sort of proposal on a musical that uses traditional music or something.
ZEN,But they wanted me to model in a hanbok;;;
ZEN,They saw a photo of me online and liked how I look;
ZEN,They said they would pay well;;
ZEN,"The group’s called Drop the Beat…. What a name, huh?"
ZEN,I told them I’d think about it.
ZEN,"God… I can say no to this modeling job,"
ZEN,but do you think they’d make good party guests?
ZEN,They seem to be a pretty reputable group.
ZEN,They do a lot of shows.
MC,Sounds fantastic!
ZEN,That’s good to hear.
ZEN,I’ll tell them to send you an email.
ZEN,I’ve been looking for potential guests to help you.
ZEN,I’m glad you like my suggestion!
MC,I don’t really think it’s a good idea.
ZEN,Really?
ZEN,Oh well then.
ZEN,I’ll try looking for other potential guests.
ZEN,I feel like I’m getting more modeling gigs
ZEN,than acting jobs;;;
ZEN,"A couple months ago, this apple farm contacted me."
ZEN,They said that my face is perfect and would look great as a model for their apples;;
ZEN,They contacted me after looking at my photo online too…
ZEN,Where the hell do they see my photos?
MC,Maybe they’re spreading around social media?
ZEN,"I don’t really use social media, so I don’t know;;"
ZEN,I’m worried I’ll just get popular with my looks… and no one will care about my acting or singing.
MC,Maybe there’s a Tripter bot that spreads your photo nonstop? lol
ZEN,"What? Nah, no way…;;;"
ZEN,Would anyone be so desperate to get my name out?
ZEN,I heard it’s not that easy to do that;;
ZEN,But what’s important is
ZEN,that I start a new role soon…!
ZEN,Ugh…
ZEN,I should go for a run and think about it.
ZEN,It’s good to take jobs
ZEN,that are offered to me…
ZEN,but I want to be up on stage more.
MC,Try thinking it out while jogging. Bye.
ZEN,"Yup, I should lol"
ZEN,"MC, see you later!"
ZEN,Bye!
MC,I would love to see how you sweat while running.
ZEN,"If you want, I’ll send you a selfie."
ZEN,"People say that when I sweat,"
ZEN,they can feel passion from me. lol
ZEN,"Apparently, my eyes glisten."
ZEN,How can my eyes glisten so much even when I’m tired…?
ZEN,Maybe I was born to be an actor. lolol
ZEN,"Anyways, I’ll get going!"
YOOSUNG,MC~
YOOSUNG,I completed the quest I didn’t finish earlier and beat a boss monster!
YOOSUNG,Feeling as good as ever~!
MC,"You must be very tired, haha."
YOOSUNG,"Haha, it’s nothing ^^;;"
YOOSUNG,I’m only doing what I have to do!
MC,How was school?
YOOSUNG,Fine!
YOOSUNG,I had a very comfortable journey in my van!
YOOSUNG,But Zen lolol
YOOSUNG,Wrestler body guards? lolol
YOOSUNG,Even the ones who came to me
YOOSUNG,looked like models
YOOSUNG,like what Jaehee said;;;
YOOSUNG,Why do you think that is?
MC,It is God Seven’s doing. God Seven!! Please enlighten us with your presence!
YOOSUNG,Lolololol
YOOSUNG,Do you think Seven used his hacking skills to arrange it? lolol
MC,I think Jumin did that on purpose. lolol He’s actually pretty funny.
YOOSUNG,What~ No way!
YOOSUNG,I doubt Jumin did that on purpose.
YOOSUNG,"It must be just a coincidence, haha."
MC,I know ^^; Zen must have been really flustered.
YOOSUNG,lolololol
YOOSUNG,I think he’s still kind of shocked. lolol
YOOSUNG,Square shoulders and marble muscles;;;
707,Oh.
707,No.
707,Yes.
707,Nope.
707,Yup!!
707,No.
707,No~!!!!!!
707,Uhm··· MC
707,Aaaargh!
707,I let MC see my consciousness splitting!!
MC,Please don’t send ridiculous texts.
707,I’m sorry.
707,I didn’t want you to see me like this…
YOOSUNG,But what’s no?
MC,It’s okay… haha. But what were you talking about?
YOOSUNG,I guess you don’t care me seeing you like that;;
YOOSUNG,But what’s no?
707,I can’t focus.
YOOSUNG,Huh? ;;
YOOSUNG,Why are you being so weak? It’s not like you.
707,"To be honest,"
707,I can’t help but keep watching the CCTV feed even when it’s not my turn.
707,I keep getting worried about MC…..
MC,Then come see me~!
707,But I can’t go right now.
707,I still have more work to do;;;
707,I would have gone straight away if it weren’t for that damn Vanderwood!!
YOOSUNG,Huh?;; Your maid gets in the way?
707,No… Well…
707,Yeah…
YOOSUNG,;;I thought she was watching the CCTV with you?
707,Yup yup.
YOOSUNG,I just feel like you’re being contradictory;;
MC,Stop caring about me and just focus on work.
707,I’m trying…
707,but why do my eyes
707,keep turning towards the CCTV screen?
707,Is God controlling me!?
707,Or is there another hacker who’s controlling me!?
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,"Well,"
YOOSUNG,I guess Seven’s the only one
YOOSUNG,who can protect MC right now…
YOOSUNG,He must feel a lot of pressure.
YOOSUNG,Then why don’t you at least send over the puppy robot?
707,The puppy robot?
YOOSUNG,Yeah!
YOOSUNG,You spent all that time making it.
YOOSUNG,Maybe it can protect MC at least a little bit?
MC,To be honest… I want one ^^
YOOSUNG,See!
YOOSUNG,MC says she wants one too!
707,But it spits out real fire… It’s dangerous;;
MC,Hey. What if I get burned?
707,Ya…
707,What if something like that happens…?
707,"If MC gets hurt,"
707,I’d never be able to forgive myself…
YOOSUNG,You just tell her how to properly use it~!
YOOSUNG,"Or maybe you just take out that feature,"
YOOSUNG,"and give it to her as a souvenir or something, haha."
707,It’s not a souvenir.
707,I just made it because I couldn’t focus.
YOOSUNG,Come on~
MC,What matters is the intention~! I would love for you to give it to me.
YOOSUNG,"Haha, MC says she wants it."
707,Hmm;
YOOSUNG,"Even if it doesn’t help her,"
YOOSUNG,it’ll represent how much you’re worrying about her so I think it’s a good idea!
MC,Yeah. Don’t waste your time on something like that now.
707,She’s right.
707,I should stop wasting my time…
YOOSUNG,It wasn’t a waste of time.
YOOSUNG,You were just expressing how much you’re worrying about her.
707,Worrying about her!?
YOOSUNG,Ya.
707,You think…?
707,"I’m just so nervous,"
707,and feel worried
707,and wanna make gifts
YOOSUNG,Seven;; What’s up with you?
707,and I can’t focus
707,and I keep wanting to turn on the messenger
707,and see the CCTV just in case she’s at the hallway
707,and I want to call her!!!
707,Gahhh. I feel like I’m about to explode.
YOOSUNG,Seven;;;
YOOSUNG,Are you serious?
707,I’m going crazy.
707,My concentration is my gift!!!
707,Maybe my brain is melting
707,because I had too much caffeine!?
YOOSUNG,Caffeine doesn’t melt brains!
707,That’s true.
MC,Stop spamming;;;
YOOSUNG,Don’t be so cold…
YOOSUNG,I think Seven actually
YOOSUNG,kind of revealed his feelings
YOOSUNG,by spamming without knowing.
YOOSUNG,"feelings for you, MC."
707,F E E L I N G S?
MC,Seven… You don’t…!?
707,My brain is not wired to have such emotions.
YOOSUNG,But I kind of thought that too…
707,What thought?
YOOSUNG,;;Since you have feelings for MC
YOOSUNG,"you get worried, want to make gifts, and all that."
707,H A V E F E E L I N G S?
YOOSUNG,Yes!
YOOSUNG,"I’ve never been in a relationship,"
YOOSUNG,but I’ve read a fair amount of relationship advice books!
YOOSUNG,"If you have someone you have feelings for,"
YOOSUNG,"you keep staring at your phone,"
YOOSUNG,"can’t work because you’re thinking about that person,"
YOOSUNG,and keep on wondering what he or she likes.
707,Ya…
707,But I read Expert Playboy
707,and it didn’t mention anything like that.
YOOSUNG,That book is about being a playboy;;
YOOSUNG,Pick some proper books.
YOOSUNG,I usually read shojo manga.
YOOSUNG,Hmm… You should really read the one called “Honey and Butter”.
707,No way. Yoosung is recommending me books.
MC,I think taking action is more important than listening to a boy who’s never dated girls before. I’m ready!
YOOSUNG,Seven! MC says she’s ready! lololol
707,Uhm.
YOOSUNG,"If you really do have feelings for her,"
YOOSUNG,"then I support it one hundred percent, haha."
707,How am I supposed to react here?;;
YOOSUNG,You two get along really well!!
YOOSUNG,And she always responds to your jokes. lolol
707,"Haha,"
707,"well, we’re just playing around;;"
MC,Why would you read weird books like that? ;;
YOOSUNG,Huh? ;; What do you mean they’re weird~?
YOOSUNG,You have no idea how much relationship wisdom is in those books! lolol
YOOSUNG,And the novels are really fun too~
YOOSUNG,"In books like that you always see the timid male character making something for the girl he likes,"
YOOSUNG,and then not being able to give it to her.
YOOSUNG,He always ends up regretting it! Like 3 years later;;
707,Hmm;;
YOOSUNG,There’s even evidence that you like her.
YOOSUNG,It’s true that you made the puppy robot!
YOOSUNG,You just made it for fun?
707,"Well, no, that’s…"
707,i couldn’t really calm down and was all over the place.
707,It just put all the parts together itself and created itself.
MC,Stop being ridiculous and just focus on work.
707,Ya.
707,I should… but I can’t.
707,I can’t get used to myself being liket his.
707,I can’t be like this.
YOOSUNG,;;Don’t change the subject!
YOOSUNG,Be serious about it.
MC,Creating itself with the blessing of God Seven… This is almost a myth.
707,Greek Seven Mythology.
YOOSUNG,"You made that robot, dude;;;"
YOOSUNG,Stop saying ridiculous things.
YOOSUNG,What I was trying to say is
YOOSUNG,"If you cared enough to create a robot,"
YOOSUNG,then I’m sure you developed feelings for her!
YOOSUNG,All that’s left
YOOSUNG,is the beginning of a romantic relationship~!
YOOSUNG,I haven’t even gone close to that!! T_T
707,lololol
707,Romantic lolololol
MC,This isn’t the time for that.
707,Ya…
707,It’s not the time to think about this.
MC,Romantic… That sounds nice! I want to experience what that’s like~★
707,Hmm…!
707,I want to live in a world where that’s possible…
YOOSUNG,A romantic relationship is totally possible in the world we live in. lolol
YOOSUNG,Why are you backing out~
707,Because
707,I don’t do things like that. lol
707,I’m going to spend my whole life staring at the computer. lol
707,Romantic relationships are not for me >.<
YOOSUNG,What;;;
YOOSUNG,I don’t think that makes sense…
707,Yeah…
707,I don’t think I make sense either.
707,;;I don’t know why I made that puppy robot.
707,Should I throw it away;?
MC,Just throw away useless crap. It’ll just get in the way.
707,Useless crap…
YOOSUNG,"Still, you shouldn’t throw it away…"
MC,Don’t!! Someday you’ll use it for something!!
707,I doubt it…
YOOSUNG,It looks fine. Why do you want to throw it away?
YOOSUNG,Seven;;
YOOSUNG,I feel like you need Zen’s advice right now;;
YOOSUNG,He’s the most experienced one in terms of relationships.
707,"Well, it’s been a while…"
707,since Zen’s been in a relationship…
707,···
YOOSUNG,"Well, that’s because…"
707,Gahh!!!
707,So I made a robot. Big deal.
707,I even manage the Tripter bot.
MC,You do a lot of things…
YOOSUNG,What do you mean?
707,So I didn’t tell you.
MC,The Tripter bot?
YOOSUNG,??
707,Didn’t I say??
YOOSUNG,What?
707,I’ve been managing a Tripter bot
707,that spreads Zen’s photos around.
707,A hundred photos every day~
707,"Just the good ones, of course."
YOOSUNG,OMG….
YOOSUNG,For real!?
MC,You’ve been doing something good for Zen~!
707,Yup lol
707,I’ve been increasing the number of girls having heart attacks with his photo on their computer screens.
YOOSUNG,Why didn’t you mention that!?
707,I just forgot after making it;;
707,My pure innocent heart
707,only wished Zen the best
707,f
MC,"That’s nice of you… but you did get his permission, right?"
YOOSUNG,"Those photos… you are censoring them, right?"
707,….
YOOSUNG,Right???;;
707,"I, Seven,"
707,am
707,A
707,GOOD
707,B
707,O
707,Y
707,"Anyways,"
707,seeing Zen get more popular
707,makes me feel good.
YOOSUNG,I like Zen getting more famous too…
YOOSUNG,but don’t you think spreading his photos behind his back is a bit too much? ;;
707,What are you talking about?!
707,"Now that I’ve said it here,"
707,it’s not a secret anymore…
707,I just forgot to mention it until now. lol I never tried to hide it or anything >_<
YOOSUNG,;;;;;;
MC,So you’ve been hiding it on purpose.
YOOSUNG,"You didn’t post any strange photos, did you?;;"
MC,Like··· the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing!
707,That exactly. lol
707,The world is a better place with more people knowing Zen’s existence.
707,"The more people, the better."
YOOSUNG,"Well,"
YOOSUNG,he kind of said the same thing yesterday..;;
707,Ya.
707,"I make the world a better place by catching hackers behind the curtain,"
707,but Zen has to work to purify the world where everyone can see him!!
MC,"Haha, the fact that Zen exists does make the world a better place."
707,He’s way more
707,handsome than me…
707,and he’s a good actor
707,plus a terrific singer…
707,And he’s not sketchy!
YOOSUNG,And you’re sketchy?;;;
MC,Right you are~!
707,Hurrah!
707,Photos of Zen shall brighten up the world!
YOOSUNG,Uhm… I don’t really know about that;;
707,"Anyways,"
707,the fact of matter is
707,I have a heart that is so pure and firm like a glass marble
707,that I can just whip out
707,robots and bots. lol
707,There’s no way I have lovey dovey feelings for someone. lol
YOOSUNG,Seven.
707,Yeah?
YOOSUNG,Don’t throw away the robot…
MC,"Seven, weren’t you working?"
MC,Seven….
YOOSUNG,Seven…
YOOSUNG,I don’t think you’re being honest;;
707,Honesty is a luxury for me. lolol
707,What if I go out of my way to be honest
707,and something bad happens?
YOOSUNG,"Seven! Alright, I get it so just promise me that you won’t throw the robot away."
707,Oh right!
707,"I was working, wasn’t I."
707,Bye Yoosung!
707,"You take care, okay MC?"
YOOSUNG,Omg;;
YOOSUNG,I didn’t even get a chance to say good bye.
YOOSUNG,Don’t you think
YOOSUNG,that Seven is being a bit weird…?;
MC,I feel like he’s trying to avoid talking about his feelings.
YOOSUNG,My thoughts exactly!
YOOSUNG,He seemed to just flat out deny everything
YOOSUNG,once we started talking about dating;;
MC,He’s always weird.
YOOSUNG,"I mean, he is a bit eccentric,"
YOOSUNG,but he usually messes around with things like that. He wouldn’t just deny everything.
YOOSUNG,The way I see it….
YOOSUNG,it seems like he’s developed feelings for you…
YOOSUNG,"Maybe he’s still shy, haha;;"
YOOSUNG,I wish he’d be more honest!!
MC,"I hope that’s the case, haha."
YOOSUNG,I’m glad you like him too.
YOOSUNG,You two seem really good together.
YOOSUNG,"You guys have a similar sense of humor,"
YOOSUNG,"and you seem to be really understanding of him, haha."
MC,"Uhm, I wouldn’t really feel comfortable about that."
YOOSUNG,Oh really?
YOOSUNG,It’s honestly the first time I’ve seen him so evasive
YOOSUNG,so I personally would like to see it work out...
YOOSUNG,"Anyways,"
YOOSUNG,I’ve taken my break
YOOSUNG,so I have to get back to my home world!
MC,Have fun being a social outcast!
YOOSUNG,Haha.
YOOSUNG,"If I do well though,"
YOOSUNG,I get treated like a hero!
YOOSUNG,Bye!
MC,Aren’t you gaming too much..?
YOOSUNG,This is nothing!
YOOSUNG,I have to maintain my rankings at least lolol
YOOSUNG,See you later!
JAEHEE,"Hello, MC."
MC,Hello.
JAEHEE,I hope you’re doing well.
JAEHEE,"I’m going home in a van and I must say, it’s very comfortable."
MC,Hey Jaehee~ Did you get off work?
JAEHEE,I’m on my way home…
JAEHEE,It is very comfortable traveling in a van 🙂
ZEN,"Heya Jaehee,"
ZEN,and hey MC lolol
JAEHEE,Hello.
MC,Hi!
ZEN,hi hi
JAEHEE,I’m worried about Yoosung.
JAEHEE,I think he’s overly addicted to games.
ZEN,lololol I think that’s a fact by now.
MC,Isn’t Yoosung gaming too much?
JAEHEE,Yes.
JAEHEE,I think that is all he does these days.
ZEN,lolol There’s nothing you can do about it.
JAEHEE,I maybe worrying too much…
JAEHEE,but it would be better for him to focus more on his studies.
ZEN,"Well, Yoosung’s always been like that so whatever."
ZEN,But isn’t Seven a bigger problem right now?
ZEN,He’s supposed to be catching that damn hacker
ZEN,but he’s been spamming the whole internet with my photos?;;;
ZEN,It’s embarrassing;;
JAEHEE,Oh… the Tripter bot.
MC,I think Seven is so talented at everything lol
JAEHEE,"He does, however, tend to use his talents on strange things."
ZEN,We won’t know whether or not it’s strange until we see it.
ZEN,He does tend to give proper help when he tries;;
MC,Didn’t he go over the line doing something like that without your permission? …
JAEHEE,"His methods weren’t very ethical,"
JAEHEE,"but considering that Zen’s been getting modeling jobs, I think he’s been helpful."
MC,"Jaehee, you didn’t know about the bot?"
JAEHEE,"No, unfortunately I was not aware."
JAEHEE,I should take my time and search for it.
ZEN,Please let me know if you find it;;
ZEN,No wonder I’ve been getting so many modeling jobs.
JAEHEE,"Anyways, I’m sure he did it for Zen’s sake."
JAEHEE,General popularity is quite important to people with Zen’s career.
ZEN,That’s true;;
ZEN,"I’ll have to see how he’s doing it,"
ZEN,but I am thankful that he’s taking the time to help me…
JAEHEE,He would have been much more appreciated if he had notified us first..
ZEN,I probably would have told him not to do if he told me though.
JAEHEE,Why not? Social media can be a very powerful PR tool if you use it strategically.
ZEN,"Well;; I’m grateful that he wants to help,"
ZEN,but he’s already helped me a lot…
ZEN,Like that time when he uploaded that video of me….
JAEHEE,That’s true.
ZEN,"Then, I got the thought that"
ZEN,Seven is…
ZEN,trying to vicariously enjoy fame through me;;
MC,I knew he had a hidden agenda.
ZEN,"Well, I don’t think it’s a hidden agenda…"
ZEN,More like him trying to express himself in some way…?
ZEN,"He said something similar before,"
ZEN,that he’d stay in the dark
ZEN,and I should be the one under the spotlight;;
JAEHEE,Oh…. I remember.
MC,I think he said something similar yesterday.
JAEHEE,Did he?
ZEN,Ya.
ZEN,He did say that I should be the one to be under the spotlight;;
ZEN,"Since he can’t really reveal himself because of what he does,"
ZEN,I think that maybe he’s helping visible people like me
ZEN,to see how his efforts actually make a difference.
ZEN,"No one can really see what he does, do they?"
JAEHEE,"That is possible,"
JAEHEE,but I wonder if he has such complex emotions when all he does is joke around.
ZEN,"You never know what he’s thinking,"
ZEN,but I kind of felt it.
ZEN,He’s really sincere when he tries to help.
ZEN,Why else would he do that when nothing’s at stake for him? ;;
JAEHEE,If that’s what you felt… I suppose it’s possible.
MC,I think Seven is being a bit odd.
JAEHEE,I think so as well.
ZEN,Ya?
MC,"Anyways, shouldn’t he be appreciated since it ultimately helped Zen?"
ZEN,Ya. That’s true.
JAEHEE,"We’ll have to see the Tripter bot… but yes, it was very nice of him to help."
JAEHEE,I’m actually quite worried about his attitude today.
ZEN,Oh… him whining about not being able to focus? lolol
JAEHEE,Yes…
JAEHEE,He seems to be unable to trace the hacker because he is too worried about securing MC’s safety.
JAEHEE,"Usually, he would have taken care of it by now…"
MC,I still think he just has ADHD.
ZEN,"I mean, even if he does have ADHD,"
ZEN,his focus is wayyy better than normal people…;;
JAEHEE,That’s true…
ZEN,I think that
MC,But Seven denied that he has feelings for me…
JAEHEE,He did.
ZEN,Hmm… I think
MC,I’m sorry that I’m so attractive… T_T
ZEN,lololol
ZEN,Yeah…..
ZEN,But are you really sorry? lol
JAEHEE,Do you think it’s true that Seven has fallen for MC…?
ZEN,Yup.
ZEN,"as Yoosung said,"
ZEN,Seven has feelings for MC. lol
ZEN,You can just tell by the way he talks to her. lolol
JAEHEE,Well… I can’t be sure.
JAEHEE,He is a very eccentric person.
ZEN,"The way I see it, he is 100% interested in her! lol"
ZEN,I’m sure that he’s just staring at the CCTV feed and ignoring all his other duties for the agency.
JAEHEE,"If that’s true, it can’t be good."
ZEN,"He seems to be unaware of his own feelings,"
ZEN,or maybe just denying them.
MC,He seems to be quite contradictory.
ZEN,I understand why you’d think that. lolol
ZEN,One minute he’s joking around
ZEN,and the next he’s talking about our lives being threatened;; lol
MC,Maybe he needs time?
ZEN,I think that’s the answer. lol
JAEHEE,Well…
JAEHEE,I’m not an expert on this…
JAEHEE,so I won’t get involved in this one ^^;
ZEN,That’s the wise choice to make!
ZEN,Hahaha
JAEHEE,Hmm…
ZEN,Gahh~
ZEN,The deal didn’t go through
ZEN,"but I had to pose all day to show the clients,"
ZEN,so I’m pretty tired right now.
JAEHEE,You should go rest.
MC,Have a good time with the body guards~
ZEN,You mean have a good time while they are around…
ZEN,I just wish they wouldn’t stare at me…
ZEN,I don’t know if they are here to protect me or to spy on me;;
JAEHEE,;;;I’m sure they are for your protection.
ZEN,I hope so T_T
MC,Go and rest~! It must have been a rough day.
ZEN,"Yup! You rest up too, MC."
ZEN,I’ll get going then.
JAEHEE,Of course! Rest up and talk to you soon.
ZEN,"Okay, bye ^^"
JAEHEE,"To be honest… I’m saying this because you’re the only one here,"
JAEHEE,but the fact that there is a Tripter bot concerning Zen that I didn’t know about
JAEHEE,is giving me
JAEHEE,a mental breakdown ^^
MC,And I thought you were the know-it-all fan!?
JAEHEE,I suppose I missed it because I was busy with work.
JAEHEE,"As soon as I get home and finish work,"
JAEHEE,I will find that bot
JAEHEE,and thoroughly investigate whether or not
JAEHEE,that bot is ONLY a good influence on Zen’s career.
MC,But you were busy!
JAEHEE,"Still, how could I have missed something about him…?"
JAEHEE,"As soon as I get home and finish work,"
JAEHEE,I’ll have to find it and do a thorough investigation.
JAEHEE,Oh…
JAEHEE,Thankfully I’m almost home.
JAEHEE,I’ll get going.
MC,Don’t work too hard and rest up~
JAEHEE,"Yes… I will. You too, MC."
MC,Hope you find that bot!
JAEHEE,Thank you. ^^
JAEHEE,Have a good night.
YOOSUNG,"Hey, MC!"
YOOSUNG,Gahh…
YOOSUNG,I just gave everyone a bus ride!
YOOSUNG,I should skip this round.
YOOSUNG,+_+
MC,Did you get a job as the bus driver?
JUMIN,What will you do about school then?
YOOSUNG,Hey Jumin!
YOOSUNG,"No, it’s not a real bus lolol"
YOOSUNG,It’s a term we use in LOLOL.
JUMIN,Game jargon…?
YOOSUNG,"The players have to move from continent from continent,"
YOOSUNG,but some can’t because their levels are too low.
YOOSUNG,So we call taking the people trapped inside a continent
YOOSUNG,to somewhere else
YOOSUNG,giving them a bus ride…
MC,"Hello, Jumin ^^"
JUMIN,"Hello, MC."
JUMIN,But a bus ride?
JUMIN,Not anyone can drive a bus.
YOOSUNG,That’s not it. lolol.
YOOSUNG,Low level users are likely to be killed by monsters
YOOSUNG,when traveling to a continent far away.
YOOSUNG,So I take them there
YOOSUNG,while protecting them.
YOOSUNG,That’s called giving them a bus ride. lol
JUMIN,Didn’t realize such a system exists.
YOOSUNG,Ya. I mean it’s not an official one…
MC,Yoosung… Aren’y you too addicted to games?
YOOSUNG,My mom told me that I should try my best on everything I do.
JUMIN,I see she is very open-minded.
YOOSUNG,"Well, of course… if she finds out that I’m trying my best at gaming,"
YOOSUNG,she’ll start nagging me… like crazy..
MC,"It’s a game, but I suppose it’s a proper society of its own."
YOOSUNG,LOLOL is a cyber kingdom in its own right.
JUMIN,Psycho kingdom?
YOOSUNG,No!!!! A cyber kingdom!!
YOOSUNG,Jumin;; that’s a dangerous thing to say!!.
JUMIN,…Do you give cab or train rides as well?
YOOSUNG,No… Don’t get too deep in it;;;
JUMIN,"You are getting compensated, I hope?"
YOOSUNG,Of course! lolol
YOOSUNG,I have so much gold~!
JUMIN,"Yes, that is the only way deals work."
MC,What do you think Seven is doing right now?
YOOSUNG,Probably working…
YOOSUNG,or maybe managing that bot again?
JUMIN,Hmm…
MC,I thought you were just volunteering lolol But you were paid for it.
YOOSUNG,Yeah lolol
YOOSUNG,I have to make a living you know. lol
JUMIN,Of course. That is very natural.
MC,"Yoosung, you seem pleased about the deal lolol"
YOOSUNG,Yup! I feel like I did actual work. lol
JUMIN,It’s natural to get compensated for work in a capitalistic society.
JUMIN,Even
JUMIN,cyber spaces have clearly defined deals.
JUMIN,I don’t know why Luciel
JUMIN,always helps Zen without any compensation.
YOOSUNG,"Oh,"
YOOSUNG,you mean the Tripter bot?
JUMIN,"Yes. I mean, I don’t know what that is exactly, but still."
YOOSUNG,It’s just a program that produces automated posts on social media about a certain topic….
JUMIN,"Anyways,"
JUMIN,I have no idea why he breaks the Give & Take rule.
YOOSUNG,"Friends can help each other out without getting anything in return, lol"
JUMIN,So they were fairly close.
YOOSUNG,Why are you so interested? lolol
JUMIN,I simply think it’s against common sense.
JUMIN,Zen always refuses my strategic negotiations but appreciates Luciel’s free help.
YOOSUNG,Oh;;
YOOSUNG,I guess you can see it that way.
YOOSUNG,Hmm…
YOOSUNG,Did you read what Zen said earlier?
JUMIN,What did he say?
YOOSUNG,That Seven seems to be vicariously enjoying Zen’s popularity.
MC,"He said something similar yesterday, and I could understand it… if you consider Seven’s career."
YOOSUNG,Yeah… Since he always works where no one can see him.
YOOSUNG,Isn’t it sad to think that
YOOSUNG,"no matter how well you do your job, it can never see the light of day?"
JUMIN,Not at all.
YOOSUNG,T_T
MC,"Anything that is “vicarious” can’t be good, since it’s too dependent."
JUMIN,I agree.
JUMIN,Vicarious satisfaction is nothing but an illusion.
YOOSUNG,But Seven has no other choice…
YOOSUNG,"Jumin, you’ve always lived under people’s attention"
YOOSUNG,so I don’t think you can really understand people who aren’t really noticed.
JUMIN,Is Lucien someone people can’t notice?
YOOSUNG,"I mean, he’s super loud and out there here!!"
YOOSUNG,But he always has to hide who he is because of what he does for the intelligence agency…
JUMIN,That’s true…
YOOSUNG,People aren’t really noticeable like Seven or me…
YOOSUNG,can feel proud of sharing myself through someone else~!
MC,But isn’t it all pointless because I’m not the one enjoying the result?
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,You do not get compensated in the end. So isn’t it meaningless?
YOOSUNG,"But you’re compensated mentally, and that can be significant."
YOOSUNG,"I’m not really noticeable in reality,"
YOOSUNG,but I’m pretty important in virtual society.
YOOSUNG,"When I play games, I feel comforted…"
JUMIN,I would feel a bit empty. It’s only temporary relief.
YOOSUNG,That’s… kind of true.
YOOSUNG,You feel empty and lonely… But… you feel proud when you see others doing well.
JUMIN,Proud… I’d like to test it.
MC,I feel bad that Seven’s job has so many restrictions…
YOOSUNG,Yeah.
YOOSUNG,He can’t ever take credit for what he does and no one recognizes it.
YOOSUNG,I think he’d be jealous of Zen for getting everyone’s attention.
YOOSUNG,"I’m not much of a help to others in reality,"
YOOSUNG,but a lot of people actually wait for me in LOLOL. lol
YOOSUNG,I feel really good when I help those people and hear them say thanks.
YOOSUNG,So I kind of understand how Seven feels.
JUMIN,Have you ever wanted to be more noticeable in reality?
YOOSUNG,Yes… Of course.
YOOSUNG,"But that’s not easy as it seems, haha…"
YOOSUNG,"Since I live alone,"
YOOSUNG,I feel like I’m almost a ghost now that I’m in college;;
JUMIN,Don’t you have your parents?
YOOSUNG,Huh? ;; My parents?
JUMIN,"Yes. When I’m with my father, I feel more stable about myself."
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,Well… lolol I guess I won’t be a ghost if my mom gives me attention.
YOOSUNG,I did have a regular life in high school when I lived with my parents.
YOOSUNG,I woke up at six
YOOSUNG,"showered, ate breakfast, memorized some vocabulary,"
YOOSUNG,"and go to school, and then come back, eat"
YOOSUNG,"take a shower again, and study…"
MC,Really!? You?? Study?!
YOOSUNG,"Yeah, haha. I had no choice but to because of my parents…"
MC,Sounds like a normal day of a high school freshmen.
JUMIN,"Yes, I remember you were completely different from how you are now."
JUMIN,I offered you an internship then.
JUMIN, Since I considered you a diligent and hardworking candidate.
YOOSUNG,"Ya. To be honest, my mom’s a huge part of how well I did then."
YOOSUNG,"She would tell me off when I would slack off even for a little… So it was tough,"
YOOSUNG,but I guess that’s all love.
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,Family love.
YOOSUNG,"Now that I’m living by myself,"
YOOSUNG,sometimes
YOOSUNG,I miss my mom nagging at me.
JUMIN,If you miss her scolding you… you are in serious trouble.
JUMIN,Yes… Parents are very important.
JUMIN,Alright.
JUMIN,I should try doing something good for free.
JUMIN,I will share a part of myself through you and feel proud of it.
MC,"What’s up with you, haha?"
JUMIN,His story actually inspired me.
MC,"Well, there’s no need to waste your precious energy on me;;"
JUMIN,I only want to test it out.
YOOSUNG,Huh?
YOOSUNG,What do you mean?
YOOSUNG,What? He just left…? ;;
YOOSUNG,What do you think he meant? Sharing a part of himself through me?
MC,I don’t think it’s anything important.
YOOSUNG,You think? hahaha
YOOSUNG,Sometimes Jumin can be really weird too;;;
MC,Maybe he wants to do something for you?
YOOSUNG,For me?
YOOSUNG,+_+
YOOSUNG,I hope he gives me premium coupons for LOLOL.
YOOSUNG,There’s a high chance to acquire a rare item if you’re on the premium server.
YOOSUNG,"Anyways,"
YOOSUNG,my parents
YOOSUNG,both of them are government officials…
YOOSUNG,so they always like having strict routines…
YOOSUNG,"If you go off that routine just a bit, they start scolding you… T_T"
YOOSUNG,"When I was in high school,"
YOOSUNG,I didn’t even dream of gaming!
YOOSUNG,"I do miss my mom’s cooking,"
YOOSUNG,but if I have to study things I hate
YOOSUNG,"with my mom nagging me all the time,"
YOOSUNG,I’d rather live by myself like a loser like this. lol
YOOSUNG,Isn’t it so great?
YOOSUNG,"I can game all I want,"
YOOSUNG,"sleep when I want,"
YOOSUNG,"wake up when I want,"
YOOSUNG,"sleep, wake up, and then sleep, wake up!"
MC,"Enjoy it while you can, lol"
YOOSUNG,You are so right! ^^
MC,I’m jealous.
YOOSUNG,Hahaha.
YOOSUNG,I can’t live like this much longer though.
MC,But shouldn’t you still try to maintain a regular lifestyle?
YOOSUNG,MC….
YOOSUNG,"You’re worrying for me, right? ^^"
YOOSUNG,Thanks.
YOOSUNG,"But,"
YOOSUNG,I feel like the bright moon is giving me its blessing…
YOOSUNG,"It means that tonight,"
YOOSUNG,I will rage.
YOOSUNG,"Today, I will make an exception,"
YOOSUNG,and be the angel of LOLOL
YOOSUNG,who helps
YOOSUNG,those low levels in need!
MC,So cool… For better fame and glory!!!
YOOSUNG,"Yup, you totally get me, lolol"
YOOSUNG,"Oh man, I’m getting excited just thinking about"
YOOSUNG,how many people will be waiting for me today!
MC,Don’t game too much though ^^
YOOSUNG,I’m always…
YOOSUNG,trying my best to keep it under control…!
YOOSUNG,The problem is that I just try… lol
YOOSUNG,Then bye! lol
707,MC…!
MC,Are you looking at me…?
707,Of course!
707,Now once every 2.15 seconds…
707,"Maybe it’s because of that,"
707,but time seems to be flying by…
MC,God Seven!! How’s work going!?
707,Oh my god.
707,It’s midnight already T_T
707,How can the day past by so meaninglessly!
707,MC…
707,I wanted to take care of the hacker fiasco today;;
707,But I couldn’t even get the work done for the agency…
707,It’ embarrassing T_T
MC,You shouldn’t have made that robot then;;
707,Why did I? T_T
707,Gahhhhhh
MC,Don’t feel too much pressure. You can always do it tomorrow!
707,I’m sorry.
707,You must be an angel
707,to encourage someone so pathetic like me...
707,I feel like time flew by exceptionally fast today…
707,But…
707,I’m surprised to see that
707,Yoosung understands me.
707,"I’m thankful,"
707,"but if you think about it,"
707,Yoosung is not like me…
MC,How is he different?
707,He has parents who scold him
707,and can complain about them.
707,I…
707,"can’t do that, haha."
MC,Yeah… I guess Yoosung’s more normal.
707,"Yes, that’s true."
707,I can’t say that I’m normal.
707,The way I talk and my job and all that.
707,Haha
707,Hahaha
MC,Did you run away from home?
707,"It’s not like that, haha."
707,I hope I get to tell you about it one day
707,if I ever get too…
MC,God Seven… Don’t be weak!!!
707,Gahh!
707,"I guess it’s because it’s late, but I’m not in a good mood."
707,You be careful too.
707,You might sink into the ground if you are so down. lol
707,"Anyways, MC,"
707,"don’t let your spirits get down,"
707,and don’t start guessing about me. lolol
MC,"Why~? I want to know more about you, Seven."
707,Don’t be!
707,You’ll get hurt if you do!!!
707,I don’t want you to get hurt.
707,I really mean this!
MC,I hope you didn’t try to rhyme just now?^^ ++
707,"I tried… my best, but epic failure…."
MC,"Yeah, you should be sorry;;;"
707,I will repent!
MC,y
707,So many thing happen in this world
707,and I don’t want to complicate things further.
707,"But if people start guessing,"
707,then you have no choice but to have complicated thoughts lolol
707,So please don’t talk about me vicariously enjoying Zen’s life or something like that…
707,707 is supposed to just laugh things off and make fun of everything.
707,That’s me! ☆
707,"Thankful that not mush is happening,"
707,"and with God deep inside my heart,"
707,I am
707,SEVEN
707,ZERO
707,SEVEN!!
707,…!
MC,Hmm…
707,Don’t be so serious about it.
707,I get comforted by the fact that there is something in this world that will never change.
707,God is always in my heart.
MC,Do you really believe in God?
707,The only thing I can take in this world
707,is the God that I believe in.
707,Because God never changes.
707,I can’t ever desire or have….
707,what I don’t deserve.
MC,"Why are you being so sad…? Seven, you can have anything you want!"
707,lololol I really hope that’s the case…
707,Oh lololol
707,MC….
707,Seriously…
707,What’s wrong with me?
MC,I guess your world must be complicated. I’m not really interested though.
707,"Oh sorry, haha."
707,I guess I bothered you by talking about it.
707,I must be tired;;
707,I’ll try hard not to bother you.
707,But I guess… this is still how it is.
707,"Even when I know that nothing is happening,"
707,I just feel like something dangerous will happen.
707,I feel like my brain is malfunctioning or something.
707,I…
707,I have a memory card that can’t save anything.
707,"When I turn off the engine,"
707,I have to… give everything up…
707,Gahh
707,I wanna explode!
MC,Just let everything go… Be yourself.
707,I don’t even know what I’m like anymore.
707,I feel like… even I will forget who I was.
MC,"Yeah, I really can’t understand you Seven."
707,I’m sorry.
707,I’m a bit all over the place today.
707,I feel so weird that
707,I wanna travel to the moon!
707,"On the moon,"
707,I wouldn’t be a secret agent!
MC,"Let’s go to the moon together someday, haha."
707,Will that day come? haha
707,I’d love that…
707,I’d love to go with you.
MC,There’s not enough oxygen on the moon.
707,Don’t worry.
707,We probably…
707,won’t have a chance to go together ^^;
707,I really have to get myself together
707,and start working for real tomorrow…
707,Since I have to finishing my work for the agency
707,to trace the hacker…
MC,That damn hacker!!
707,Yeah!
707,The reason why I’m a mess
707,is all because…
707,of that hacker!!!
MC,"Yeah, you should really pull yourself together."
707,Yeah!
707,I should get my shit together.
707,Oh right!
707,There’s a group called Hackers Chasing Hackers.
707,Do you think it will help the party? lol
707,It crossed my mind since all I’m thinking about is hackers right now ^^;;
MC,Yeah! I guess you’ll feel better if they come?
707,lololol
707,Oh yeah!
707,I’m gonna mess the hell out of them haha.
MC,Hackers…? Let’s not invite them.
707,Oh….
707,Sorry.
707,Hackers are putting us in danger right now ^^;;
707,I should have thought better.
707,Hmm;;
707,I guess I was weirder then usual today.
707,I’ll get going.
707,"Tomorrow,"
707,I’ll really try to do my job
707,and finish everything!
707,"As long as my engine is on,"
707,I will protect MC!
MC,Thank you… I can feel God Seven’s good graces protecting me ^^
707,Hahaha.
707,Thank you
707,for saying that ^^
MC,Yeah. Good luck keeping an eye out.
707,"Like a cute meerkat protector in the lonely dessert,"
707,I will guard everyone
707,with glistening eyes!
707,"MC,"
707,good night!
MC,"Bye, Seven."
707,Bye.
707,Don’t worry and rest.
MC,"If it gets too tough, just think of me and feel better!"
707,Oh…
707,"I can’t stop thinking about you though,"
707,and that’s not good…
707,Haha.
707,"Look at me, I’m saying gibberish again."
707,Then bye.
MC,"Jaehee, good evening."
JAEHEE,"Good evening, the stars are very beautiful today."
JAEHEE,It’s a shame I have to work even at home today.
JAEHEE,"I was planning to search for the bot as soon as I finished work,"
JAEHEE,"but I am getting very tired,"
JAEHEE,so I think I will have to go to bed while watching Zen’s DVD to end the day.
JAEHEE,"And regardless,"
JAEHEE,"I had something I wanted to ask Seven,"
JAEHEE,but he’s not here right now.
MC,Is something up?
JAEHEE,I received a suspicious email on my personal email account…
JAEHEE,and the content and attached photo were quite strange.
MC,I have dibs on Seven so watch out…!!
JAEHEE,I don’t know what you were thinking ^^;;
JAEHEE,But I only wanted to ask him about a suspicious email I received on my personal account.
JAEHEE,And I’m quite surprised to hear that you have dibs on Seven.
JAEHEE,Take a look at this.
MC,;;;
JAEHEE,This is the photo that was attached in the email.
JAEHEE,It was too creepy to just ignore it…
MC,I don’t feel good about it…
JAEHEE,Right?
JAEHEE,I was quite surprised too.
JAEHEE,The sender is called Mint Eye.
JAEHEE,I’ve never given out my personal email address… This is the first time I’ve received a spam message.
JAEHEE,"I thought of deleting it,"
JAEHEE,but it didn’t contain any links or anything.
JAEHEE,It only contained a couple sentences and this photo. It’s not like normal spam messages.
JAEHEE,And doesn’t that logo seem quite suspicious to you?
MC,Yes… I don’t feel good about it. You should ask Seven.
JAEHEE,"Yes, I was planning to."
MC,I think you should talk to the cyber police.
JAEHEE,"It’s not that I don’t trust the cyber police,"
JAEHEE,but I heard they receive reports of thousands of spam messages every day.
JAEHEE,I wonder whether they would take this seriously when it doesn’t even look like a spam email.
JAEHEE,"Besides,"
JAEHEE,I may be the only one to think this…
JAEHEE,but I felt as if someone is watching me.
JAEHEE,Perhaps it’s some religious or charity organization…
JAEHEE,"Regardless, it’s quite disturbing."
JAEHEE,"Anyways, this means that my personal information has been leaked,"
JAEHEE,so I thought Luciel might able to help me find who exactly sent the email to me
JAEHEE,But…
MC,I don’t think Seven is really helpful to anyone right now.
JAEHEE,Hmm… I think that he needs time to focus on himself.
MC,I’m kind of worried about Seven. He doesn’t seem very well.
JAEHEE,He seems to feel so complicated that it’s affecting his work…
JAEHEE,I would feel bad to give him another task.;;
JAEHEE,Luciel was always the one to finish his work perfectly
JAEHEE,and then present it in a strange way…
JAEHEE,But he seems to have become very sentimental…
JAEHEE,He said that God is the only thing he can have…
JAEHEE,Should we be worried…?
JAEHEE,I don’t feel good thinking about him…
JAEHEE,But I have never been very friendly with Seven so I don’t know what to say.
JAEHEE,"I hope Zen or Yoosung… or even you, MC, give him some encouragement."
MC,I don’t really think we should worry.
JAEHEE,Do you think so?
JAEHEE,I hope I’m being unnecessarily anxious…
JAEHEE,But it’s the first time Luciel has had trouble working.
MC,I’ll try talking to him…
JAEHEE,I think you are quite special to him.
JAEHEE,Oh…
JAEHEE,Look at the time.
JAEHEE,I must finish work and go to bed while watching a DVD of Zen’s musical.
MC,"If you have any good photos, share them with me! Good night!"
JAEHEE,Of course.
JAEHEE,Great works shine brighter the more they are shared with others.
JAEHEE,^^
JAEHEE,"Have a good night, MC."
ZEN,MC… You’re here.
ZEN,OMG..
ZEN,Jaehee’s email;;;
MC,"Hello, Zen… What about the email?"
ZEN,Actually…
ZEN,I woke up to the alarm from getting an email.
MC,I missed u lovely Zen ♡
ZEN,Really? ♡
ZEN,….is what I wish I could say
ZEN,but that’s not what’s important right now.
ZEN,I got the same email that Jaehee got…!
ZEN,The exactly same disturbing email!
ZEN,"I get a ton of spam messages,"
ZEN,but none of them were this creepy;;
ZEN,I can’t believe that we got the same email…
ZEN,I hope it’s something everyone got…
ZEN,But I feel so iffy about it. I can’t stay still;
ZEN,I should definitely ask him!
MC,I think Seven would say that it’s just a spam message.
ZEN,You think?;;
MC,I wish my hubby would check the messenger asap!
ZEN,Hubby???;;
ZEN,You’re very straightforward.
ZEN,Such a good-natured person. lol
ZEN,But it kind of bothers me
ZEN,that Seven
ZEN,seemed really troubled
ZEN,last night.
ZEN,Do you think he’ll be okay?
MC,He never makes sense anyways. I don’t think there’s anything to worry about.
ZEN,Maybe…
ZEN,"Well, I guess he did go on about the moon and squid and all that~"
ZEN,He was his usual ridiculous self. lol
MC,I’m quite worried…
ZEN,"Ya… He sounded bright,"
ZEN,but wasn’t it sad what he sad?
ZEN,"But, MC…"
ZEN,"Seven told us not to make any guesses about him,"
ZEN,but listen to this;;
ZEN,Seven…
ZEN,has never really explained to us
ZEN,about his career.
ZEN,We just assumed that it was some cyber hacking job and kind of ignored it.
ZEN,"But… the more I think about it, the more dangerous it sounds."
MC,I think so too…
ZEN,Hmm…
ZEN,"Since he’s an intelligence agent,"
ZEN,don’t you think he made some sort of pledge to never reveal the things he know? ;;
MC,Shouldn’t we avoid him if he has a dangerous job?
ZEN,Seven is an RFA member just like you and me.
ZEN,"Just because he has a dangerous job, we can’t just cut him off now!"
ZEN,My guess is that
ZEN,Seven’s job is tohack into something to dig out sensitive information
ZEN,"but if you want to do that, you have to thoroughly hide your info and traces…"
ZEN,Maybe that’s why he uses a strange name 707.
ZEN,You always see CSI or FBI agents on TV~
ZEN,"If they do one thing wrong and their covers are blown,"
ZEN,everyone around them plus the organization they work for are put in danger.
ZEN,So some even kill themselves before they’re tortured;;
ZEN,Thinking about it gives me goosebumps.
MC,"Zen, I think you watched too many movies;;"
ZEN,Hmm… You think?
ZEN,"Still, I think it’s something similar;"
ZEN,I feel like he lives underground
ZEN,just to avoid others knowing about him…;;
MC,I wish nothing like that ever happens to Seven.
ZEN,Of course nothing like that should happen!…
ZEN,But we don’t really know exactly what he does
ZEN,so all we can do is guess;;;
ZEN,"Come to think about it,"
ZEN,I’ve only seen Seven pay cash…
ZEN,He doesn’t have any cards.
ZEN,"Besides, a couple days ago, he said that Luciel isn’t his birth name."
ZEN,And he seems to avoid talking about his parents.
MC,I’m sure he’s a suspicious and twisted man.
ZEN,Well… he does give off that vibe
ZEN,but I think he has his own reasons.
MC,I do think that none of us know much about Seven… I want to know more about him.
ZEN,It’s a bit funny saying this…
ZEN,"But compared to all the years we’ve known each other,"
ZEN,I don’t think I know much about him either…
ZEN,I even think that you understand him better than us;;
ZEN,"Still, we’re in the same organization,"
ZEN,and yet we don’t even know what kind of work he does and how hard he works.
ZEN,We didn’t know that he has a maid until couple days ago;;;
ZEN,Maybe V knows a bit more;;
ZEN,A job where I have to hide myself would never suit me;;
ZEN,I can’t even imagine what it would be like to never confidently reveal who I am…
MC,Just thinking about it makes me sad…
ZEN,Yeah.
ZEN,He doesn’t have to be the mermaid that turns into sea foam.
MC,Why does he need to live so complicatedly?
ZEN,I don’t know…
ZEN,"The title “intelligence agent” seems cool and all that,"
ZEN,"but personally, it’s not for me;;"
ZEN,Haha
ZEN,"Seven told us not to guess around, but I guess I did it again. lolol"
ZEN,"I don’t know his exact situation… but if he’s feeling depressed, I hope he cheers up."
ZEN,"We won’t be able to help with his work,"
ZEN,but we can be there for him…
ZEN,"Especially in the area of relationships, I, Zen am the best consultant amongst everyone in the RFA."
ZEN,"I haven’t been able to see anyone because of work,"
ZEN,but I can give some killer advice on how to be a true man.
ZEN,"People think that I get girls without doing anything,"
ZEN,but it does take some effort on my part.
ZEN,And you need to know some manners too.
MC,Why are suddenly talking about relationship? haha
ZEN,Because even intelligence agents need to go on dates.
ZEN,Love is a powerful motivator for life.
MC,I’m not really interested in dating;
ZEN,That’s what Seven said too.
ZEN,But he definitely didn’t act that way. lol
ZEN,I’m curious what your real feelings are too.
ZEN,^^
ZEN,Hmm…
ZEN,"Sorry to change the subject,"
ZEN,but this is trouble. lol
ZEN,I’m woke up really early today so I’m getting hungry.
MC,Just starve. Look at the time;;
ZEN,"You think? Yeah, I guess if I eat right now I’ll get really puffy."
ZEN,Damn…
ZEN,But I don’t think I’ll sleep
ZEN,if I don’t eat something.
MC,Time for some night time snacks!
ZEN,Night time snacks…
ZEN,Would it be okay? lol
ZEN,I might be really puffy in the morning if I eat some ramen with eggs…
ZEN,I’ll just get a little snack!
ZEN,MC…
ZEN,Dream about me!
MC,I will!!
ZEN,Don’t get a heart attack because you saw me in your dreams.
ZEN,"If you start hyperventilating,"
ZEN,"just take deep breaths, okay?"
ZEN,"If you still can’t breathe, just imagine me doing CPR on you."
ZEN,Or maybe that will make things worse?
ZEN,Haha.
ZEN,See you soon~
ZEN,Bye!
MC,I want to dream about Seven.
ZEN,"Oh~ MC, you’re really honest, haha."
ZEN,Of course…
ZEN,"Have fun with him, and try to cheer him up."
ZEN,Then bye!
707,Meow meow~
707,MC!
707,"I was a total downer yesterday, right?"
707,Got my vibe back!!!
MC,Are you feeling better now? ^^
707,Yup!!!
707,I usually get sentimental and
707,"depressed late at night, lol"
707,I’m fine now.
MC,What Zen said last night… He was really considerate.
707,Ya.
707,He’d be perfect if he stops being so narcissistic.
707,Zen
707,I feel bad that I made everyone worry about me;;
MC,No need to be sorry…
707,Really?
707,It looks pretty cool to me...
MC,I wish God Seven would cheer up soon!!
707,Okie!
707,I feel much better already though! lol
707,"But more than that,"
707,I wanna transform
707,into the Defender of Justice! lol
707,Oh!
707,I brought a photo that will
707,"erase the image of gloomy Seven from everyone’s mind, haha"
707,Tada!
707,Photos that Ms. Vanderwood took★
MC,Ooh!! Seven you look so handsome!
707,"Why thank you, thank you."
MC,Hi Jumin
707,Hellooooo
JUMIN,He;;o
JUMIN,Hello
707,GAP+2
JUMIN,What does that mean.
MC,Don’t mind it.
707,Next-to-be Chairman’s Gap Moe
707,has increased by 2…!
707,Why am I the only one who gets this? T_T.
MC,Next-to-be Chairman’s Gap Moe has increased by 2.
707,You’re thinking what I’m thinking!
707,MC! lol
JUMIN,Gap moe…?
707,Ya.
707,Do u know what that means?
JUMIN,Doesn’t it mean when a character’s contradictory characteristics make him likable?
MC,"I don’t know what it is, but it sounds difficult…"
JUMIN,Nothing to fear. You can just look it up on the dictionary.
707,That’s on the dictionary!?
JUMIN,Haven’t you ever heard of the urban dictionary?
707,I haven’t… but I want one +_+.
MC,Wow! I’m amazed at your knowledge!
707,;;; Who taught you that!
JUMIN,It’s in urbandictionary.
707,I’ve never seen that dictionary. Does it even exist?
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,Gap moe…
JUMIN,I’d like to practice if I have the potential…
JUMIN,I wish to be charming to Elizabeth the 3rd.
707,…And that was the timid confession of a cat lover.
MC,"Jumin, you’re quite cute."
JUMIN,"Sorry, but I’m not cute."
707,What do you mean? lol
707,The fact that you like cats make u KEWT! >_<
JUMIN,…Let’s change the subject.
MC,"Seven, are you gap moe?"
707,Oh!
707,Do you think I can be such a multi-dimensional character? TT
JUMIN,"Considering how sentimental you were yesterday, I think you can."
707,Please forget last night;;;
JUMIN,"Well, that’s that."
JUMIN,About that email Zen and Assistant Kang received.
JUMIN,I received it too…
707,For real!?
JUMIN,Did you get it?
707,No…
JUMIN,"How about you, MC?"
MC,I don’t know anything about it.
707,Maybe you don’t know how to access your emails? ;;
707,You can see it if you go to the email section at the main menu. lol
707,Check it later.
MC,I didn’t receive it.
707,I didn’t too!
JUMIN,Perhaps you two didn’t check your emails?
707,Hmm… But I did;;
JUMIN,"It’d be fine if it’s simply a spam message,"
JUMIN,but the content was quite disturbing.
707,"Jumin,"
707,forward it to me;
707,I should trace the email just like what Jaehee and Zen said.
JUMIN,I will.
MC,Trace it fast.
707,I’m sure you feel iffy because of all the strange things that have been happening. T_T
707,I’ll try to take care of it as soon as I can!
MC,"But… Seven, don’t you have enough work already?"
707,Yup. I’m busy!
707,But I can’t miss a single clue!
707,I’ll trace it as soon as I have time.
JUMIN,I thank you for your dedication.
707,"I, Seven, am"
707,always ready to sacrifice myself
707,for RFA members. lol
JUMIN,Ready to sacrifice yourself?
JUMIN,then….
JUMIN,I was thinking that you should go to MC yourself to protect her if you finish the work…
MC,"Jumin, can’t you just get my address and send me body guards?"
707,No!
707,No address
707,No bodyguards.
JUMIN,Then more so.
MC,Good thinking ^^
707,What?
JUMIN,Since I can’t send bodyguards to MC.
JUMIN,Time out?
707,I suddenly thought of something to test. lol
707,I have to get going!
JUMIN,You could at least give me an answer.
707,Nope. Busy.
JUMIN,Hmm.
MC,T_T… You just said you’re ready to sacrifice yourself… You’re not coming to save me?
707,Gahh…
707,"I’m ready,"
707,"but if you meet someone like me, your life will get messed up."
MC,I knew you were just words.
JUMIN,Didn’t you say that all you did was stare at the CCTV feed because you’re worried about her?
JUMIN,I think it would be better for you to go to the apartment and just stay there…
707,Gahhhh!!!!
707,My first and last cat is Elly!
JUMIN,What in the world are you talking about?
JUMIN,Elizabeth the 3rd is not your first cat.
707,"Anyways,"
707,"you said you’re going on a business trip today, right?"
707,Have a safe flight.
707,"And take care of yourself, okay, MC??"
707,I’ll get going!
MC,Alright… go.
707,See you later!!!
MC,Good bye.
707,Bye!!!
707,Make sure to keep the door locked!
707,Promise me…!
JUMIN,"It’s quite funny,"
JUMIN,"but seeing him be ridiculous again,"
JUMIN,he’s back to the Luciel we know.
MC,"Yes, I’m glad he seems to have cheered up."
JUMIN,Although I regret not having convinced him to go protect you.
JUMIN,I’ll be leaving for the middle east in a couple of hours...
MC,When are you leaving?
JUMIN,"It’s a morning flight, so I have to get going soon."
JUMIN,Just thinking about how we barely acquired the present for the oil prince… God.
JUMIN,It’s all thanks to Assistant Kang.
JUMIN,I’m sure we’ll get a good deal if we give him Shinewing’s CD and DVDs of Korean Dramas.
JUMIN,"Oh, right."
JUMIN,Why don’t you request the oil prince to attend the party?
JUMIN,Oil is a crucial energy source.
MC,No.
JUMIN,"That’s unfortunate, but it’s up to you."
JUMIN,I should look for other potential guests.
JUMIN,Perhaps I should look for other people who like cats…
MC,Good! Oil is an important energy source!
JUMIN,Good decision.
JUMIN,"Since oil is a hot topic for international meetings, his attendance will help our party."
JUMIN,The prince told me that the desert cats in the middle east are very beautiful.
JUMIN,I can’t be the only one to witness such a beautiful creature.
JUMIN,So I made an exception and decided to take Elizabeth the 3rd with me.
JUMIN,I’m sure it will be a good opportunity for her to broaden her knowledge on her species.
JUMIN,What do you think?
MC,A cat wouldn’t know things like that…lol
JUMIN,I’m disappointed that you think that way.
JUMIN,You cannot interpret the subtle signs animals give in human terms.
MC,You really do understand cats!
JUMIN,There are several cats in this world. They must know to respect one another as well.
JUMIN,It’s no different from human society.
JUMIN,I’m relieved that you think the same.
JUMIN,Oh.
JUMIN,I just remembered that I should go see my father before I leave.
JUMIN,"No matter what happens,"
JUMIN,you always have to say talk to your family before you leave on a trip…
MC,You’re right. I think Yoosung also needs some help from his family…
JUMIN,I think so as well.
JUMIN,I’m sure he’s losing his confidence and becoming lazy because there’s no one around to take care of him.
MC,"Yes, but if you are too close, it’s easier to hurt one another."
JUMIN,"People do say that the closer you are to someone, the more you are likely to hurt them."
JUMIN,But… if you can’t take care of yourself like Yoosung…
JUMIN,perhaps you do need some help from your family.
JUMIN,I’m sure that his family will help him be a bit wiser.
JUMIN,Yes…
JUMIN,I must take action.
JUMIN,MC.
JUMIN,I have to get going. There is somewhere I have to call for the sake of that boy.
MC,Be careful~! Have a good flight.
JUMIN,Thank you. You take care too.
JUMIN,"If you need anything, contact Assistant Kang."
MC,Good bye.
JUMIN,I’ll have a tight schedule if I’m going to go see father.
JUMIN,"Have a good day, MC."
JUMIN,Bye.
Vanderwood,"Zero Seven, are you really going to be like this?"
707,Yes.
Vanderwood,"What? Yes!? Hey, you look at me… And stop eating those weird chips! You haven’t finished a fraction of the work you were supposed to do today. What am I going to tell the boss?"
707,I’m going to finish it. The day’s still young~. Have a positive mind and some hope…!
Vanderwood,"Oh, all you did was fool around today and now you’re giving me advice?"
707,"Oh come on~ Mister~ Just wait a minute~ My delicate heart doesn’t feel ready yet~ But first, is everything fine at the apartment?"
Vanderwood,"Is this all I get for practically living at your house to clean your room, feed you, and stare at that damn CCTV feed…?"
Vanderwood,"I’m not blind. Ever since the messenger was hacked, all you’ve been doing is tracing that hacker! And you’ve been tracking that weird email the whole day!"
Vanderwood,You think I came here to volunteer as your maid because I have so much free time?
707,Ma’am. Can I say something?
Vanderwood,Stop joking around… I have a taser in my bag.
707,Agent Vanderwood.
Vanderwood,What.
707,"If you just talk to the boss and stall some time, I can finish the work for RFA first and then really focus on the work for the agency."
707,I can’t get things done because I’m trying to do everything all at once…!
Vanderwood,No.
707,Why?!
Vanderwood,We’re already past the deadline and you know that this job has higher risks!
Vanderwood,I didn’t tell the boss that you work for the RFA considering that you became an agent so young… But if you delay this task further I’ll have to inform him.
Vanderwood,"If things get delayed like this, those in the upper division can take it the wrong way! You and me, both! They can take us out from the face of the earth without anyone knowing!"
707,"Yes. you are right, agent Vanderwood."
Vanderwood,Then realize the gravity of the situation and focus!
Vanderwood,We’re not allowed to have personal lives because things like this might happen.
Vanderwood,"You have to finish this by today. If you don’t, I’ll report to the boss about RFA. Then they might put you in some mental facility. You’ll never get to see that girl trapped inside the apartment."
707,…
Vanderwood,"I know that you can’t help but think about the RFA… But we have to be alive first! No, Agent 707?"
707,Yes… We do.
Vanderwood,Now you’re answering properly. You’ve always done well. What’s up with you? You can’t focus and create some strange robot…
707,You’re right… What’s wrong with me?
Vanderwood,"I’m worried about your involvement with RFA. If this goes wrong, and you get taken away, what will be the use of RFA or that charity party?"
Vanderwood,"Even if they put you back, they’ll give you a completely new identity. You know how excruciating that is…"
707,I do.
707,"You’re right, Agent Vanderwood."
Vanderwood,Okay. I’m glad you understand. I feel good that I managed to convince you. Let’s get a cup of coffee and start again.
707,Alright…
Vanderwood,"I’ll go get coffee. We focus again after taking a short break, okay?"
707,Ok.
Vanderwood,Then go clear your head for a bit.
707,God… Yeah. This isn’t for me. This anxious feeling…
707,Luciel… Get your shit together. You have to live first. That’s the only way RFA will remain…
707,But why do I have such a bad feeling about this…?
707,Something feels strange… I just feel like something will happen to MC…
707,I can’t focus. Damn…
YOOSUNG,Hi MC!!
MC,Hello.
YOOSUNG,Hello! ^^.
MC,"Yo yo, wassup!! LOLOL warrior!"
YOOSUNG,"Haha, you’re so right but it’s kind of embarrassing to hear that!"
YOOSUNG,But don’t take it back! haha
YOOSUNG,Makes me feel good!
YOOSUNG,Did you eat breakfast?
MC,I always starve.
YOOSUNG,You can’t starve!
YOOSUNG,Especially in the morning you have to eat something so that your brain can function properly…
YOOSUNG,That’s why my professor said.
YOOSUNG,I’m a bit late too but I came for brunch ^^
MC,"Yes, I did."
YOOSUNG,You can’t ever skip breakfast!
YOOSUNG,I’m kind of late
YOOSUNG,so I just came for brunch. lol
YOOSUNG,It’s a shame that I’m at the school cafeteria…
YOOSUNG,"but hey, always be happy when you’re eating!"
YOOSUNG,"It’s just the cafeteria,"
YOOSUNG,but my bodyguards came with me
YOOSUNG,"and everyone’s staring at me like I’m some movie star, haha."
YOOSUNG,I can just see in their eyes that they’re thinking ‘how famous is he to have so many bodyguards?’ lolol
MC,Stop being such a douche.
YOOSUNG,I don’t plan to post this on fb or anything T_T…
YOOSUNG,I’ll just enjoy the moment T_T
MC,"So jealous~ You must feel like a celebrity, haha."
YOOSUNG,"If I knew this was gonna happen, I wouldn’t have gamed as much yesterday."
YOOSUNG,I was gaming all night so I have huge dark circles…
YOOSUNG,That bothers me a bit;; lol
YOOSUNG,"But MC,"
YOOSUNG,I practiced a new skill on LOLOL yesterday and it was BOMB! lol
YOOSUNG,I can’t stop thinking about my character…!
YOOSUNG,I keep replying the scene where I teamed up with my party members and defeated that badass dragon…
YOOSUNG,Talking about it makes me wanna go home and play the game again ^^;;
YOOSUNG,Maybe I should ditch my last class lol
MC,"Just ditch it! Hey, enjoy your life."
YOOSUNG,Should I? haha
YOOSUNG,"To be honest, if the bodyguards didn’t wake me up this morning,"
YOOSUNG,I would have missed school completely. lol
MC,Aren’t you spending too much time gaming? I’m a bit worried.
YOOSUNG,"I’m glad that you’re thinking of me, but it’s okay lolol"
YOOSUNG,I still came to school.
YOOSUNG,Haha.
YOOSUNG,Although the bodyguards did have to wake me up.
YOOSUNG,From where do you think
YOOSUNG,Jumin called earlier?
YOOSUNG,Why would he call for my sake? lol
YOOSUNG,"You don’t think he’s bringing a cat from the middle east, do you?"
MC,Maybe he’s calling the game addiction prevention center?
YOOSUNG,No way!
YOOSUNG,I’m not that addicted…. am I????
YOOSUNG,I eat properly and go to school!
YOOSUNG,"I heard that if you get admitted there, you can’t even touch a computer,"
YOOSUNG,and they make you go through picture therapy or something…;;;;
YOOSUNG,Haha… Probably not;;
MC,Maybe he’s calling your professor?
YOOSUNG,No way…!!
YOOSUNG,It’s not as if I played LOLOL during class or anything…
YOOSUNG,"Besides, my professors actually like me. lolol"
YOOSUNG,Sometimes they use me for their experiments lolol
MC,Maybe lololol
YOOSUNG,I hope he doesn’t…
YOOSUNG,My house doesn’t need another animal besides me.
YOOSUNG,Hahaha
MC,"Oh, right. Yoosung, you didn’t receive any strange emails?"
YOOSUNG,"You mean the one that Jaehee talked about, right?"
YOOSUNG,That picture
YOOSUNG,totally creeped me out;;;
YOOSUNG,I can’t believe everyone else got it too…
YOOSUNG,I didn’t get anything…
YOOSUNG,…
YOOSUNG,Oh.
YOOSUNG,I didn’t check my emails yet.
YOOSUNG,I’ll have to check later!
YOOSUNG,I use Bahoo email….
YOOSUNG,"and the last time I checked it,"
YOOSUNG,I had more than 2000 spam emails in my inbox lol
YOOSUNG,It’ll take some time for me to see whether or not I got that email.
MC,"Yoosung, you’re so cute. lolol"
YOOSUNG,Is having more than 2000 spam emails cute? haha
YOOSUNG,My only crime is giving out my personal info everywhere lolol
MC,Omg… Bahoo lololol So old-school;;;
YOOSUNG,"They say that old-school is the best, haha."
YOOSUNG,"I mean, I’m kinda too lazy to create another account,"
YOOSUNG,but I’ve been with Bahoo from the beginning.
YOOSUNG,I can’t help but be a bit attached to it. lolol
YOOSUNG,Right now…
YOOSUNG,"my eyes and wrist hurt really bad,"
YOOSUNG,so I’ll have to take a break and check my email later.
YOOSUNG,Focusing on gaming is practically physical labor T_T
YOOSUNG,I heard that your wrists won’t hurt that bad if you use an ergonomic keyboard…
YOOSUNG,I’m thinking of buying one.
YOOSUNG,It’s a must for healthy gameplay!
YOOSUNG,So I looked into it earlier… and I found a research center for keyboards specialized for gamers.
YOOSUNG,They sell keyboards and mouses… They seemed to sell other computer accessories.
YOOSUNG,Oh!
YOOSUNG,Why don’t we invite them to the party? haha
MC,Hmm… I don’t think they’ll make good guests.
YOOSUNG,I guess I only thought about the gamers.
YOOSUNG,"Next time, I’ll come up with guests"
YOOSUNG,that can help more people!
MC,Let’s do that!
YOOSUNG,"Yay, I helped!"
YOOSUNG,"If I see them at the party, I should ask them for keyboard and mouse recommendations!"
YOOSUNG,I should get going to go to class.
YOOSUNG,I have to stop being on my phone and eat the rest of my food T_T
YOOSUNG,I should go to the classroom as soon as I finish
YOOSUNG,and get some shut eye at the back seat…
YOOSUNG,I’m so sleepy…
YOOSUNG,I wish LOLOL released a mobile version…
YOOSUNG,Then I would never fall asleep during class.
YOOSUNG,"Haha, isn’t this a genius idea?"
MC,Make a suggestion to the company lolol
YOOSUNG,I can actually send direct messages to the manager.
YOOSUNG,They thanked me saying that
YOOSUNG,"if I hadn’t given everyone the bus ride, the continent levels would have been too dispare. lolololol"
YOOSUNG,The balance of LOLOL is all up to me!! >.<
MC,It’s not good to be so obsessed with games..
YOOSUNG,Wouldn’t it be better to game
YOOSUNG,instead of falling asleep though?
YOOSUNG,Or maybe not…
YOOSUNG,Then I’ll go finish my meal.
YOOSUNG,See you later!
JAEHEE,"Hello, MC."
JAEHEE,"And good to see you, Zen."
MC,"Hello, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Hello.. ^^
JAEHEE,Did you both have lunch?
ZEN,I had a quick meal.
MC,I had lunch too.
ZEN,Oh~ Good girl!
ZEN,You shouldn’t be on your phone if you didn’t eat! haha
MC,Not yet~
ZEN,You’re not on a diet are you?
ZEN,A lot of ladies go over their way to not eat to lose weight…
ZEN,I hope you don’t do that…
JAEHEE,"Yes, the world is perfectly good. Why go on a diet?"
MC,Heya Zen.
ZEN,Hey MC.
ZEN,It’s very good of you to come to the chatroom whenever I’m here ^^
JAEHEE,Isn’t the day very clear today? I hear birds chirping from the office.
JAEHEE,"The workload is the same, but I haven’t had such a comfortable lunch in a while. The quality of my day has seen such an improvement."
ZEN,Jumin went on a business trip?
JAEHEE,How did you know?
MC,"lololololol Congratulations, Jaehee."
ZEN,"Yes, congratulations."
ZEN,You seem to be in a really good mood! lolol
JAEHEE,Do I?
MC,You should still do your work.
ZEN,"No one is better than her at what she does, haha."
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,"No need to worry, MC. I plan to do my very best ^^"
ZEN,Even I would feel great
ZEN,if that jerk of a boss disappears from my sight!
JAEHEE,"Haha, yes…"
JAEHEE,"I wouldn’t say that Mr. Han is a bad boss… but as you put it, I feel great."
JAEHEE,"Moreover, he did not leave Elizabeth with me thanks to the desert cats,"
JAEHEE,so luck is finally on my side.
ZEN,"You’re thanking the desert cats, right? lololol"
JAEHEE,I would like to thank anyone who has helped this situation happen.
JAEHEE,"If I dare to wish for one more  thing,"
JAEHEE,I hope Elizabeth the 3rd finds her soulmate cat and settles there…
ZEN,lolololololol
ZEN,You totally don’t want her to ever come back
JAEHEE,Of course… This is only a selfish hope of mine.
MC,Didn’t you say you saw Zen’s DVD again last night? I’d like to hear your thoughts.
ZEN,"Oh, haha. Did you?"
JAEHEE,"Yes, I re-watched the DVD as I wait for your next piece."
JAEHEE,I was completely enraptured by the way you threw that ax as a farm boy in Love Blossoms on the Peach Tree…
ZEN,Omg… lolol Thank you! I practiced hard for that role. lolol
MC,I want Elizabeth to live with Jumin forever.
ZEN,It wouldn’t matter as long as it lives with Jumin only. lololol
JAEHEE,Yes…
JAEHEE,As long as he does not leave her with me… I can’t care less about what creature Mr. Han lives with.
ZEN,"Haha, it’s been a while since I’ve seen you this relaxed. It makes me feel good."
ZEN,But what’s more important right now
ZEN,is that email…
ZEN,I couldn’t stop thinking about whether or not it’s just a spam message…;;
MC,It feels more suspicious since that whole hacker thing just happened a couple days ago…
JAEHEE,"Yes, you’re right."
JAEHEE,"I wish it’s nothing, but since we are currently under threat,"
JAEHEE,I understand that you can’t help but be suspicious of the tiniest things.
MC,I think it’s just a spam email that everyone received.
JAEHEE,Luciel said he did not receive it…
ZEN,I can’t be sure until Seven figures it out;;;
JAEHEE,"Mr. Han has sent the email to Seven,"
JAEHEE,so time will tell the truth.
ZEN,He seemed to have enough work already;;
JAEHEE,Yes… I’m quite worried.
ZEN,Well…
ZEN,Let’s just wait for now.
ZEN,You enjoy your freedom before that dude comes back again. lolol
JAEHEE,^^
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,"I can’t be too obvious about it, but my mind is very content."
MC,I miss Jumin…. When do you think he’ll start the cat project?
ZEN,"MC, don’t talk about the cat project;;"
ZEN,Jaehee’s finally taking a break.
JAEHEE,Oh.
JAEHEE,That reminds me of something to take care of.
JAEHEE,I must plan how to further postpone the cat project ^^
ZEN,"Oh! I guess MC totally helped you, haha."
MC,I miss Seven… I wanna joke around.
ZEN,…..
ZEN,Are Seven’s jokes funny to you? Really?
JAEHEE,Since Luciel and MC’s conversation
JAEHEE,go beyond the realm we understand…
JAEHEE,You’d better just accept it.
ZEN,They really do seem to have fun together. lolol
JAEHEE,Yes ^^
JAEHEE,"Anyways,"
JAEHEE,I will enjoy my work and come back later.
ZEN,Okay! Jaehee… Good luck!
JAEHEE,"If I have time, I’ll have to search for Seven’s Tripter bot today…^^;;"
MC,"You must still have a lot of work, but I’m happy you seem more relaxed today. Good luck!"
JAEHEE,Thank you for thinking so… ^^
MC,Good bye!
JAEHEE,Bye…
JAEHEE,See you later.
ZEN,But;;
ZEN,"MC,"
ZEN,"this is just between us,"
ZEN,but don’t you think
ZEN,Yoosung is too addicted to games?
MC,He’ll grow out of it~ haha
ZEN,It’s been over a year since he’s had the time to grow out of it;;
ZEN,I think we have to do something…
ZEN,But I can’t think of what…
MC,I think it’s a bit serious… Don’t you think he needs help?
ZEN,I think so too;;
ZEN,"I wasn’t exactly the teacher’s pet at school,"
ZEN,but he really needs some help;;
ZEN,"Anyways,"
ZEN,I should go stretch and practice my vocals.
ZEN,The glorious actor Zen
ZEN,never skips training. lol
MC,lol
ZEN,You thought that I wouldn’t have to train because I’m so handsome?
ZEN,"Well then, you don’t know this."
ZEN,"The better your looks, the more people look down on you~"
ZEN,"I can never skip practice,"
ZEN,just to prove those snobs wrong!
MC,"I pay my respects to your diligence, Zen."
ZEN,"Haha, respect?"
ZEN,That’s not so bad to hear. lol
ZEN,People say they see how hard I work
ZEN,"but still see my face first before my acting,"
ZEN,so I should train my acting skills to make sure everything is more harmonious.
ZEN,Since I’m a true actor.
ZEN,I should get going now ^^
MC,Okay… Good bye.
ZEN,I’ll come back later.
ZEN,Bye! ^^
MC,"Bye, lovely Zen!"
ZEN,"Take care, lady!"
ZEN,"If you want to see me,"
ZEN,go find the Tripter bot Seven made! lol
ZEN,"I haven’t found it yet,"
ZEN,but that should comfort your loneliness.
ZEN,"Alright, my lady?"
ZEN,Later.

YOOSUNG,Jumin Han.
YOOSUNG,That guy
YOOSUNG,HE CALLED MY MOM!!!

YOOSUNG,"I will be respectful,"
YOOSUNG,so save me.

MC,What did Jumin tell your mom?
YOOSUNG,I want to know that too… T_T
YOOSUNG,What the hell did he say
YOOSUNG,that made my mom suddenly invade my room!!!
MC,Wow! You get to see your mom! Good for you ^^
YOOSUNG,What…?
YOOSUNG,hahahaha
YOOSUNG,I mean… it’s good lololol but not when it’s so sudden!!!
YOOSUNG,Sudden as in like right now!!
YOOSUNG,Why…???
YOOSUNG,Why is she coming?
YOOSUNG,I like how things are right now!
YOOSUNG,This is more fatal
YOOSUNG,"then when in the past, I nearly died looting a super rare item in LOLOL."
YOOSUNG,MC…
YOOSUNG,Do you know what kind of person my mom is?
YOOSUNG,She’s not the type to give me advice on
YOOSUNG,‘how to strike a deal with your client’…….
YOOSUNG,My mother spent
YOOSUNG,24 years as a teacher at public schools.
YOOSUNG,She taught “Home Economics”.
YOOSUNG,She has certificates in cooking food.
YOOSUNG,She is a licensed realtor.
YOOSUNG,She hold soap making classes.
YOOSUNG,She is the president of the Hansorum Apartment community.
YOOSUNG,She is the director of the Phoenix Senior Citizens Center.
YOOSUNG,"She is a member of golf clubs, fitness centers."
YOOSUNG,…Her resume never ends and she has dozens of certificates for things.
YOOSUNG,She is the most diligent person on Earth!!
YOOSUNG,I’m serious…
YOOSUNG,"If Jumin has such a good relationship with his dad,"
YOOSUNG,then I know a place called Children Good to Their Parents.
YOOSUNG,He should go there…
YOOSUNG,And leave me alone
YOOSUNG,and my peaceful and free life!!!
MC,lolololol There’s a group called that?
YOOSUNG,It’s a group I would like to recommend to Jumin.
YOOSUNG,They even practice bowing. He should learn it!!!
MC,Oh! They seem like a nice group. Can we invite them to the party?
YOOSUNG,…..Are you really doing this to me?
YOOSUNG,I’ll send them an email since you seem interested;;;
YOOSUNG,"Once my mom comes, she starts cleaning and making soap!!!!"
YOOSUNG,"Oh, and of course the never ending lectures ^^"
MC,I don’t think Jumin will listen. He’s in a plane. ^^
YOOSUNG,"Oh, right, he’s in a plane."
YOOSUNG,"I guess no matter how much I shout,"
YOOSUNG,he’ll read it when he opens a bottle of wine in his hotel room. Hahaha
MC,"Cheer up, Yoosung… Once you get through these hard times, LOLOL heaven will be waiting for you."
YOOSUNG,My LOLOL…
YOOSUNG,my world…
YOOSUNG,"The world of LOLOL is covered bu fog, my mom…"
YOOSUNG,It’s becoming blurry… my freedom is fading…
YOOSUNG,I… have to go…
YOOSUNG,"I want to rant more,"
YOOSUNG,but I can’t.
YOOSUNG,I have to clean up
YOOSUNG,if I don’t want to hear ten hours of lecturing ^^
YOOSUNG,And I can’t play LOLOL.
YOOSUNG,Haha.
YOOSUNG,I have to go.
YOOSUNG,Got a text.
YOOSUNG,She’s almost here.
YOOSUNG,Bye.
MC,lolol Finally you’re cleaning your room. Bye~!
YOOSUNG,I should have done it before…haha
YOOSUNG,I don’t even know where to start…
YOOSUNG,God all this regret… T_T
MC,Good bye… T_T
YOOSUNG,Cheer for me.
YOOSUNG,So that I can complete this new quest called cleaning my room….
YOOSUNG,….
YOOSUNG,"Oh,"
YOOSUNG,"and also,"
YOOSUNG,I went into my Bahoo email
YOOSUNG,and checked it.
YOOSUNG,I got that email
YOOSUNG,with the pictures of those weird eyes;;
YOOSUNG,It’s strange…
YOOSUNG,but my life is busy enough.
YOOSUNG,I have to leave.
YOOSUNG,Bye MC!!!!!!
YOOSUNG,T_T
707,Heya MC
MC,Hello Zen. I hope the day finds you well.
ZEN,"Uhm? lol Hello, MC."
ZEN,Or should I call you my lady…? lol
707,lolol
MC,Heya God Seven
707,Hey God MC
ZEN,lolol What in the world are you two doing? lolol
707,Playing God and Pauper
707,Heya Pauper Zen
ZEN,But both of you…
ZEN,did you see Yoosung flipping out?
MC,I can’t believe Mrs. Kim is going to go see him! I’m getting more nervous lol
707,I’m nervous too.
707,At how much trouble he’ll be in.
707,So curious
ZEN,Jumin must be crazy. lol
MC,Jumin… What in the world did he do? ;;
ZEN,Jumin that crazy jerk…
707,Crazy jerk???
ZEN,Ya.
MC,I’m not really interested in Yoosung.
ZEN,"Of course, neither am I."
ZEN,"I don’t want to be nosy about what a grown guy decides to do,"
ZEN,but didn’t he go too far this time?
ZEN,Does he think he’s a father or something? ;;
ZEN,Why would he call Yoosung’s mother?
MC,He was simply worried. Yoosung did have a horrible lifestyle these days.
ZEN,But still!
ZEN,How can he call his mother without any notice;;;
707,I guess Yoosung will
707,feel like he’s just been terrorized lol
MC,"Hahaha, well whatever happens, I’m having fun ^^ I want some popcorn."
707,I can send you some ^^
707,I’m waiting with my HB Chips.
ZEN,I’m sure it will be quite a scne
ZEN,but Jumin went too far this time;;
MC,I do think he was nosy to have called his mother without getting his permission first.
707,That’s true.
707,Totally ignored Yoosung’s choice.
ZEN,Yoosung’s an adult. He can take care of himself.
ZEN,"If I were Yoosung, I would have chased that jerk to the middle east and given him hell."
ZEN,Yoosung’s too nice to do it.
707,Mr. Director’s always the ones who makes the decisions.
707,So I guess he always thinks he’s right and did it.
ZEN,"Yeah, you’re so right."
ZEN,I would never in a million years
ZEN,understand the way he lives…
707,I think most people can’t understand his life… lol
ZEN,"When he signs in, I’m gonna have to tell him some things ;"
MC,"I don’t get your life either, Seven;;"
707,What?
707,Of course.
707,My life’s in codes.
707,11111000101010101
707,101110101010
707,1111111111
ZEN,Stop it… Stop making things so complicated!!
707,Thats the power of binary numbers.
MC,Let’s not be too harsh on him haha
707,Yup.
707,"Whatever you say,"
707,I can’t hear you lol
ZEN,I feel like I’m gonna die if I don’t say something!
707,"Don’t worry, I know how to do CPR."
ZEN,God! I should get a beer.
ZEN,Well that’s that.
ZEN,"Seven, did you"
ZEN,analyze the email?
707,oh…
707,I actually came here to talk about that;;;
707,Found who sent it!
ZEN,Really!?
MC,Wow you managed to find it so fast! You’re such a genius God Seven!
707,I★
707,AM★
707,A★
707,GENIUS★
ZEN,All those stars is making me dizzy.
707,Yup. That’s the point.
ZEN,Just tell me what you found;;;
MC,It’s just spam right?
707,Grilled spam mail
707,Yum
ZEN,Stop joking around;;;
ZEN,So it really was just a spam message?
707,It’s not spam…
ZEN,What!?
ZEN,It’s not!?
707,I was surprised too
707,when I looked into it.
707,I tracked sender’s proxy
MC,So you mean the hacker sent us that email!?
707,Yes…
MC,What does that mean? ;;
707,MC T_T
707,I guess it’s difficult to understand.
ZEN,To put it in understandable terms;;
ZEN,The hacker that attacked us two days ago sent that strange email…
ZEN,This is seriously shocking;;
707,That hacker… is definitely after us…
ZEN,Yoosung said he got it too.
ZEN,So it’s not spam. It’s for the RFA members.
707,"I didn’t get it… But yeah, I think so;"
ZEN,I have no idea what he’s after.
ZEN,And what he wants for us.
707,I… think I kind of know.
707,Maybe he’s after information…
ZEN,Information?
707,Yeah…
707,I’ll have to discuss this with V;;
707,but I’m worried about MC since she doesn’t have any bodyguard..
MC,"Please let us know what you know, Seven."
707,There’s not much I can say right now.
707,I’m sorry…
707,I’ll explain everything once I talk with V.
707,Please trust me and wait a bit.
MC,How are you going to make sure I’m safe?
707,I’ll be keeping an eye on you like right now.
707,I’mm be more attentive from now on…
707,First I have to get in touch with V…
ZEN,"Seven, let me ask you this while you’re here;;"
ZEN,What do you think that email means?
ZEN,What the hell is magenta??
ZEN,I have no clue what the message is!
707,I don’t know that too…
707,"I’ll find out more about it,"
707,so I think everyone should
707,stick with their bodyguards for the time being…
ZEN,God…
ZEN,Fine…
MC,"Seven, aren’t you without a bodyguard too? Are you okay?"
ZEN,Yeah;;; Are you fine without a bodyguard?
707,lololol
707,I’m the Defender of Justice.
707,My faith in God and my gate are my bodyguards.
MC,So I’m still the one in most danger.
707,It is dangerous since the information is all located in the apartment.
707,But since I know about the hacker…
707,I’ll try to trace any moves they might make-
ZEN,"Seven, are you safe?"
707,Well lol My gate protects me! lolol
ZEN,But you need bodyguards when you leave the house.
707,I don’t leave the house.
ZEN,Isn’t it kind of suffocating?!
707,Well now with this hacker fiasco
707,I don’t really have time to feel suffocated…
707,"I rarely go out anyways, unless it’s for work."
ZEN,…
ZEN,Isn’t that kind of a problem?
707,I’m fine.
707,It’s bearable so far.
ZEN,Bearable? ;;;
MC,You might become antisocial like that…
ZEN,Hmm… She’s not wrong you know;;
707,"Haha, I can be antisocial. It doesn’t matter."
ZEN,Don’t say that;;
MC,Let’s go out for some fresh air together once this ends ^^
707,Oh! Good idea. lololol
707,I’ll ask V next time. lol
ZEN,lololol Yeah… We can all hang out after the party.
707,Ya. If all gets resolved and things go well…
ZEN,So what are you going to do now?
707,The fact that I know their IP
707,means that I know their physical address.
ZEN,Really!?
707,Now that I know their address
707,I’ll have to get ready barge in there myself.
ZEN,Seriously!?
ZEN,Now things are going somewhere!
MC,"Yes, that’s the least you could do."
707,I’ll have to talk about it with V…
707,but I think going there myself is the best way to solve it.
MC,Won’t it be too dangerous?
707,Are you worrying for me? MC…
707,To be honest… I don’t know how else to finish this.
707,Usually you attack back or tighten the security…
707,but I feel like this hacker is just after us.
ZEN,Didn’t you say you’re busy?
ZEN,Last night… you said you had too much work for the agency.
707,Ya.
707,"I’m busy… but now that I know that the hacker is specifically after us,"
707,I’ll have to make time.
MC,"It sounds dangerous, so you should plan everything out and go by yourself."
707,That’s my specialty. lol
ZEN,"Still, you can’t go there alone!"
ZEN,At least take me with you!
ZEN,Nah.
707,"If you work for the agency, you go through these things…"
707,I’ve done more difficult missions on my own. lol
707,Don’t worry and just leave it to the expert lol
ZEN,;;What the hell do you do for the agency… things like this?;
707,lol no comment
MC,I’ll go with you!! You can’t go there alone!
707,Thank you but don’t say that…
707,How could I take you there when I don’t even know what’ll be there? …
ZEN,At least take me!
707,You can’t. You have to practice your acting;
707,And you might get a new role.
ZEN,That’s not more important than everyone’s safety.
707,It’ll be hard but I can take care of it myself.
707,I’ve done some similar things as an agent.
ZEN,Hmm…
707,I know best. Don’t worry about it. lol
MC,"Zen, you can go with him! Two men will be better than one."
ZEN,Yeah! I’ll go with you.
ZEN,It’s safer that way.
707,"No, it’s fine."
707,"You have to practice your acting,"
707,and what if you get a new role? lolol
ZEN,Hey!
ZEN,Is that important right now?
707,That is important.
ZEN,Omg;;;
707,"Zen,"
707,I’ll take care of this
707,so don’t worry about it ^^
707,Then I’ll get going
707,to prepare everything!
MC,"Don’t strain yourself, Seven… Bye."
707,No need to worry.
707,I’ll be perfectly fine.
707,"You take care of yourself, okay? MC"
MC,"You know you have to plan everything, right? Don’t make any mistakes."
707,Yup.
707,I’ll check everything multiple times.
707,I can’t afford to make any mistakes!
707,I’m in a time crunch
707,so I’ll get going!
707,Laterz
ZEN,Why is he trying to do everything on his own?
ZEN,I’m nervous about this…
ZEN,I’m worried he’s trying to take all the burden himself…
MC,"If it’s going to be dangerous, he should just go there alone;"
ZEN,I don’t think you should say it’ll be dangerous for sure…
ZEN,I’m still worried…
MC,I think so too. Everything will work out if we work together…
ZEN,Exactly.
ZEN,He could at least take me…
ZEN,I know my action moves!
ZEN,Do you think he’ll really be okay…?
ZEN,He has so many secrets.
ZEN,I’m scared everything he’s keeping inside will just blow up one day.
ZEN,I mean nothing will stop him but…
ZEN,I don’t know. I should go get some fresh air.
MC,I wish he’d just tell me everything… I’m worried about him too.
ZEN,Yeah. I wish he could just tell you everything in that playful way of his.
ZEN,I’d feel much better then...
MC,"Okay, go clear your head."
ZEN,"Okay, see you later… MC."
ZEN,And we still haven’t caught the hacker so be careful.
ZEN,I’ll get going.
ZEN,See you later.
Vanderwood,Zero Seven.
707,…
Vanderwood,Hey!
707,…
Vanderwood,What happened to that pact we made before? Do you really want to make me the bad guy here!? What’s that on the screen!? It’s about RFA right?
707,"The lives of everyone in RFA may be in danger, Agent Vanderwood."
Vanderwood,"Our clients can put people’s lives in danger as well, Agent 707."
Vanderwood,"I don’t know how much danger your RFA is in, but is their situation worse than ours?!"
707,I shouldn’t have accepted this client. It’s too dangerous…
Vanderwood,You could have said that three months ago before we accepted the fee!!
Vanderwood,We’re not in the position to choose our clients… but you should have adjusted the deadline then! It’s too late now.
707,God… I know.
Vanderwood,"Anyways, you… you really have to finish the job by today."
Vanderwood,"I’m serious. You have to be alive to do anything for the RFA, no?"
707,Alright…
JAEHEE,And I thought it was going to be such a peaceful day.
JAEHEE,I see that Mr. Han has done something again ^^
MC,Jaehee… Hello!
JAEHEE,Hello…
JAEHEE,"My day’s been good, but I suppose Yoosung’s has been going horribly? ^^;"
MC,I think this is good for him. lol
JAEHEE,Well…
JAEHEE,I’m quite amazed that you agree with Mr. Han…
JAEHEE,"I was also worried about Yoosung’s gaming since last night,"
JAEHEE,but I doubt calling his parents was the right measure.
JAEHEE,Yoosung is an adult. There’s no doubt that what Mr. Han did is inappropriate.
JAEHEE,What in the world…
JAEHEE,did Mr. Han say to Mrs. Kim
JAEHEE,to make her head over to his place instantly?
JAEHEE,^^;;
MC,Probably exactly what’s going on? haha
JAEHEE,"That he’s been staying all night playing games,"
JAEHEE,"skipping meals,"
JAEHEE,"and of course never cleaning his room,"
JAEHEE,"waking up late every morning,"
JAEHEE,and sleeping during his classes…
JAEHEE,You mean things like this…?
MC,Don’t you think he seduced her with this smooth words?
JAEHEE,Seduce?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAEHEE,"I don’t want to imagine it nor should I,"
JAEHEE,but I admit Mr. Han has a way with people.
JAEHEE,He probably talked about Yoosung’s irregular lifestyle as nice as he can…
JAEHEE,And absolutely nothing to do with seduction.
JAEHEE,It would be so great if I could
JAEHEE,"call Mr. Chairman when Mr. Han’s obsession over cats puts us in trouble,"
JAEHEE,but I do not have the courage.
MC,Why not!? Try it. I want to watch and eat popcorn.
JAEHEE,"I’d love… to let you eat popcorn,"
JAEHEE,but I don’t have the courage to put on such an entertaining show.
MC,"Yup. You have to keep your job, haha."
JAEHEE,You’re right ^^
JAEHEE,My job is very important.
JAEHEE,Oh…
JAEHEE,"I’m sorry to say this,"
JAEHEE,but there is a more important issue than Mrs. Kin visiting Yoosung.
JAEHEE,Did you see what Luciel said?
JAEHEE,Isn’t it quite shocking that the hacker is the one who sent all those emails?
MC,I’m more worried about Seven. I think he wants to take care of everything by himself…
JAEHEE,I suppose since he works as an intelligence agent… he knows how to handle such dangerous tasks.
JAEHEE,It’s true that he’s the most useful one out of all of us.
MC,I’m worried about my safety.
JAEHEE,"If the hacker is RFA, he probably wants the materials in Rika’s apartment."
JAEHEE,I understand that you’re nervous… but Luciel said he’d keep an eye on you.
JAEHEE,Let’s trust him for now.
JAEHEE,Anyways…
MC,Yes… I’m shocked that someone is after us.
JAEHEE,It’s difficult to accept that we’re a target for attack.
JAEHEE,We’re a charity organization… there isn’t any reason to attack us.
JAEHEE,Do you think they are after some kind of information… as Seven mentioned?
JAEHEE,Anyways…
JAEHEE,He said he was busy with work for the agency.
JAEHEE,I’m glad he managed to find out about the hacker so fast.
JAEHEE,"Still, the hacker is still at large, so I hope he is careful."
JAEHEE,Oh…
JAEHEE,Look at the time…
JAEHEE,Mr. Han will have arrived..
JAEHEE,I should call him and discuss the ongoing situation.
MC,"Yes, please let Jumin know of the gravity of the situation."
JAEHEE,I will.
JAEHEE,It’s unfortunate what is happening to Yoosung… but we’ll have to talk about him next time.
JAEHEE,I’ll get going.
MC,Alright. Good bye.
JAEHEE,"Bye, see you soon."
YOOSUNG,MC…
MC,Did your mother get there?
YOOSUNG,Yes….
YOOSUNG,It’s a very touching moment of family reunion.
YOOSUNG,So I can’t help but cry…
MC,"Don’t cry, my baby…"
YOOSUNG,Ugh.
YOOSUNG,"Sorry, but please don’t call me baby."
YOOSUNG,My mom calls
YOOSUNG,me baby.
MC,Just be a man.
YOOSUNG,Haha.
YOOSUNG,Can a herbivore
YOOSUNG,suddenly become a carnivore?
YOOSUNG,No.
YOOSUNG,"So,"
YOOSUNG,that ain’t gonna happen…
YOOSUNG,But that’s not what’s important.
YOOSUNG,If Jaehee reaches Jumin…
YOOSUNG,then I hope she tells me ^^
YOOSUNG,There are a lot of things I have to say…
MC,I’m sure Jumin had good intentions.
YOOSUNG,"Hahahaha,"
YOOSUNG,I want to do something for Jumin
YOOSUNG,with very good intentions too.
YOOSUNG,But I’m feel so horrible that
YOOSUNG,I can’t think of everything.
MC,"What? Omg, I need to bring my popcorn."
YOOSUNG,It’s nothing haha.
YOOSUNG,"First, after a couple shots of vodka,"
YOOSUNG,I want to show him my LOLOL lethal move.
YOOSUNG,"And you know, talk to him as if I’m talking to my friend."
YOOSUNG,"You know, all that jazz ^^"
YOOSUNG,All the lectures I’ve missed out from living here by myself
YOOSUNG,"are coming out of my mom’s mouth right now,"
YOOSUNG,and it’s so effective ^^
YOOSUNG,Yes… ^^
YOOSUNG,I missed my mom’s lectures….
MC,Bu-but think of it positively… You get to live a better lifestyle now.
YOOSUNG,Hahaha..
YOOSUNG,I don’t want to hear that right now.
MC,I guess you didn’t…
YOOSUNG,I want to escape…
YOOSUNG,I want to go far… far away….
YOOSUNG,I guess amidst all this pain I’m experiencing right now
YOOSUNG,Seven
YOOSUNG,found a clue…
YOOSUNG,Seven…
YOOSUNG,If you’re going to go confront the hacker
YOOSUNG,I want to volunteer to go!!!
YOOSUNG,I’m so passionate about it. He has to pick me!
MC,lololol That’s how much you want to escape.
YOOSUNG,No doubt about it.
YOOSUNG,Omg.
YOOSUNG,I REALLY WANT TO GO!!!!!
YOOSUNG,I’d be so happy
YOOSUNG,I wanna be anwhere out of my mom’s reach
MC,Wouldn’t it be better for me to go…? It could be dangerous.
YOOSUNG,"There’s not really a reason,"
YOOSUNG,but I think it’ll be helpful if I go instead of you.
YOOSUNG,Can’t we just say that’s the case? ^^
YOOSUNG,My mom…
YOOSUNG,brought a 30-inch luggage ^^
YOOSUNG,How long do you think she plans to stay?
MC,She’ll just stay for a couple of days ^^;; Moms always carry around a lot of stuff.
YOOSUNG,Right?
YOOSUNG,I’m just going to think that she brought a lot of stuff for no reason.
YOOSUNG,"Or else, I’m gonna go insane."
MC,A month….?
YOOSUNG,"Hahaha, no way"
YOOSUNG,"Don’t say that, hahahaha"
YOOSUNG,You have such an imagination! ^^
YOOSUNG,"Besides,"
YOOSUNG,Now I can’t play LOLOL
YOOSUNG,and I feel like the withdrawal symptoms are going to hit me soon. hahahahaha…..
YOOSUNG,The bodyguards
YOOSUNG,just keep teasing me;;
YOOSUNG,I guess they’re having fun watching me in pain.
YOOSUNG,They are being so helpful right now ^^
YOOSUNG,"When I’m cleaning,"
YOOSUNG,they come and pretend to stop me or whatnot
YOOSUNG,and then they star telling me oh this place is still dirty~ that place is still dirty~
YOOSUNG,and they are even taking pictures.
MC,Cinderella Yoosung lolol
YOOSUNG,Don’t you feel sorry for me…?
YOOSUNG,I feel sorry
YOOSUNG,for myself lol
YOOSUNG,Wow lol
MC,OMG lololol So cute lololol I wanna be your stepmother.
YOOSUNG,You’re kidding right? haha
YOOSUNG,"Don’t tease me T_T Not you too, MC…"
YOOSUNG,I don’t want people to toss me around.
YOOSUNG,Good bye my freedom…
YOOSUNG,Good bye my LOLOL…
YOOSUNG,I was inches away from conquering the world of LOLOL…
YOOSUNG,Was it a hopeless dream of a young boy?
YOOSUNG,Gahh!!!
YOOSUNG,My mom caught me hiding in the corner.
YOOSUNG,I…
YOOSUNG,I have to go read now ^^
YOOSUNG,Books.
YOOSUNG,"Not novels, my textbooks ^^"
YOOSUNG,And Seven… I hope he succeeds in catching the hacker…
YOOSUNG,But don’t catch him alone…
YOOSUNG,"If he needs someone’s help, I desperately hope he calls for me…"
MC,I pray that you can escape…!
YOOSUNG,Let’s pray together.
YOOSUNG,May the universe gather its force for Cinderella Yoosung
YOOSUNG,so that his mother would go back to where she was…
MC,…Just do your best studying.
YOOSUNG,"Next time you see Seven, please tell him."
YOOSUNG,That I am desperately waiting for God Seven’s call.
YOOSUNG,That there is a little boy who believes in God Seven so much!!!
YOOSUNG,"Then,"
YOOSUNG,the good boy Yoosung
YOOSUNG,will now go off to study.
YOOSUNG,Bye.
JUMIN,MC.
JUMIN,How is your beautiful evening?
JUMIN,Don’t worry about me. I got here safely.
MC,"Mr. Han, how is your five star hotel?"
JUMIN,Oh…
JUMIN,They seemed to have put a lot of effort. The view is fantastic.
JUMIN,I am satisfied.
MC,I’m not worried…. What happened with you calling Mrs. Kim?
JUMIN,Oh… An unnecessary fuss.
JUMIN,I was only showing a bit of kindness for Yoosung.
JUMIN,But first…
JUMIN,My room has the best view to see the desert sunrise.
JUMIN,The desert … is always so beautiful.
ZEN,Beautiful? Yeah right!!
MC,Heya Zen…
ZEN,Hey MC…
MC,"I don’t think it’s the time for you to talk about that right now, Jumin."
JUMIN,Oh and why not? Beauty must be appreciated…
ZEN,Jumin Han… You little nosy bastard!!
ZEN,Can’t you feel Yoosung’s pain!?
JUMIN,Not at all.
JUMIN,I feel proud that he’s leading a proper life now.
JUMIN,But first.
JUMIN,I got a call from Assistant Kang that we have something about the hacker.
ZEN,"Before we talk about that,"
ZEN,let’s finish what’s going on with Yoosung and Mrs. Kim ^^
ZEN,What in the world gives you the right to take away someone’s freedom and still enjoy the desert view!!!
JUMIN,I’ve only organized a family reunion.
JUMIN,Gosh…
ZEN,Gosh?
JUMIN,The hotels in the middle east are so luxurious.
ZEN,Don’t change the subject!
MC,Why the hell did you call Yoosung’s mom?
ZEN,Yeah!
ZEN,Explain yourself.
MC,I can imagine you looking at the beautiful desert with Elizabeth in your arms and drinking wine.
ZEN,Gahh!!
ZEN,Just imagining it makes my nose itch.
JUMIN,"Yes, you are imagining correct."
ZEN,Omg
JUMIN,In a room with a spectacular view of the sand desert with two of my most favorite things in the world…
JUMIN,Elizabeth the 3rd with her elegant fur and French wine.
ZEN,Don’t change the subject!
ZEN,Why the hell did you call Mrs. Kin? ;;
ZEN,Let me ask you this!
JUMIN,No significant reason.
JUMIN,To let Yoosung become more independent.
ZEN,What the hell does independence have to do with being forced to clean?
MC,The two don’t go together at all haha
ZEN,I think so too;
MC,Hmm… I think Jumin is right. Independence and parents… it makes sense!
JUMIN,Yes.
ZEN,I don’t know if MC’s quick to understand or if I’m just being slow;;;
ZEN,But what the hell makes you say that Yoosung is more independent now?
JUMIN,Listen to me.
JUMIN,A person is bound to fall if no one is there to support him.
JUMIN,What is so bad about leading a more productive life with the support of his mother?
JUMIN,Familiar bond is beautiful and strong.
ZEN,What the hell does that have to do with independence?
JUMIN,It’s all connected.
MC,"I admit that your intentions are good, Jumin!"
JUMIN,"Thank you… but if Yoosung doesn’t want his mom to be there, then he can just ask her to leave."
ZEN,"If that were so easy, he would have done it by now;;"
MC,Not all families have tight bonds.
ZEN,"Oh! MC, you’re so right."
ZEN,"You’re not always right, you jerk!"
JUMIN,"I tend to believe that all families have a tight bond, whether it’s visible or not."
ZEN,A lot of families don’t have that.
ZEN,Yoosung is an adult!
JUMIN,You shouldn’t think that someone is an adult just because he’s of age.
JUMIN,An adult refers to someone who has the courage to choose the difficult way.
ZEN,That’s what you think!;;;
ZEN,Did you put some filters in your ears?
ZEN,A filter that lets you hear only what you want.
JUMIN,Is that the trend these days?
JUMIN,I think it’ll be quite nice to develop a filter that lets you understand cat language.
MC,Oh! Good idea!
ZEN,Dude… just thinking about talking cats makes me sneeze.
JUMIN,It’s not for you. It’s for people who love cats.
JUMIN,"Yes, being abroad always gives me inspiration."
MC,I can almost hear Jaehee yelling at us to change the subject.
ZEN,Yup.
ZEN,Let’s not put Jaehee in more pain;;
ZEN,Such a self-righteous asshole….
ZEN,You still think that you’re right…
JUMIN,Families are  beautiful.
MC,"Haha, he won’t get it. Let’s just stop here."
ZEN,"God, do I have to let it go…? ;"
JUMIN,"If what I did was wrong, then I should hear it from the boy involved."
MC,"I think you should talk to Yoosung soon, Jumin~"
JUMIN,You are right.
JUMIN,"If he has complaints, I should hear it from him directly."
JUMIN,Shouldn’t you stop playing the hero who defends the weak?
ZEN,I just can’t stand what you did.
JUMIN,Oh.
JUMIN,"But first, let’s go back to the hacker."
JUMIN,Isn’t it more important that the hacker is the one who sent us the email?
ZEN,We already talked about it.
MC,"Jumin, do you know anything about that?"
JUMIN,I do.
ZEN,???
ZEN,What?
JUMIN,"At the last party, there was a group of people who wanted access to the guest list."
ZEN,What? I’ve never heard about this.
JUMIN,"You, Yoosung, and Assistant Kang weren’t informed about this."
JUMIN,I’m almost curious why Luciel didn’t mention this first.
ZEN,OMG
JUMIN,"Several politicians, corporate executives, and powerful people attended our last party."
JUMIN,I heard that their personal information were in the emails they exchanged with Rika.
JUMIN,I heard they were after that. But 707 said that he tightened the security so that wouldn’t happen.
JUMIN,I didn’t think much about it since V said it was all taken care of…
ZEN,Why are you mentioning this now!?
JUMIN,Because it was a secret.
ZEN,…And why are you telling that secret now?
JUMIN,"I didn’t plan to talk about it, but considering the current situation, everyone should know."
MC,If it’s the same group… then they really are after the information.
ZEN,Yeah;;;
JUMIN,I suppose.
MC,"Jumin, you’re way better than Seven."
ZEN,Seven’s just being careful since this is classified.
JUMIN,"Yes, he probably is."
JUMIN,"But I think that when it is clear that someone is after us,"
JUMIN,we should reveal everything that can so that there is less chance of an accident happening.
ZEN,This is all because… no one can reach V.
ZEN,What the hell is V doing right now?
JUMIN,He said he was traveling.
ZEN,He should just forget about traveling and come back!
JUMIN,"Yes, but he is not aware of the current situation."
ZEN,Ugh… This is so frustrating.
MC,It really is. He has to know about this asap…
ZEN,I wish he’d talk to us and talk with Seven so that we can feel safer.
ZEN,But he’s totally mia….
MC,"You don’t think Seven is secretly talking to him, do you?"
JUMIN,No need to have such doubts.
JUMIN,I can tell that Luciel is putting everything he can into this.
ZEN,I think it’s been almost half a year since I last saw V;;
JUMIN,"Yes, around that time…"
ZEN,He seemed to have hurt his eyes the last time I saw him… I guess he’s better now if he’s traveling.
MC,I’m jealous that he gets to travel.
ZEN,Plan a trip after this hacker thing is taken care of and the party’s finished.
ZEN,I guess if V’s travelling though
ZEN,his eyes are all better…
MC,He hurt his eyes?
ZEN,"Yeah, I heard he had a small accident or something."
ZEN,I don’t know much about it.
ZEN,Hey jerk… do you know something about that?
JUMIN,Hmm.
JUMIN,"If you are worried about his eyes, then you should talk to V directly."
JUMIN,"I gave him the contacts for Dr. Lee an eye specialist, but he didn’t talk to him at all."
ZEN,What? ;
ZEN,I guess his eyes still hurt or something? ;;
JUMIN,He’s one of the most knowledgable experts in the field…
MC,Then why don’t we invite him to the party?
JUMIN,That’s a good idea.
JUMIN,He knows things that can help everyone at the party.
JUMIN,I’ll get in touch.
MC,I guess V has his own doctor…
JUMIN,…
ZEN,"Anyways, I hope we get to talk to V soon…"
ZEN,I want to see with my own eyes that he’s fine;;
JUMIN,I got a call.
JUMIN,I have to leave.
ZEN,Work?
JUMIN,Yes. It’s time to watch the Camel Show.
MC,Wow! Have fun.
ZEN,…And that’s work?
JUMIN,Yes.
ZEN,"It’s not a show where a bunch of camels climb ladders and do a back flip or something like that, right?"
JUMIN,I don’t know. I haven’t seen it yet. Why don’t you come next time if you’re so curious.
ZEN,…Never mind.
MC,Are you there for work or for pleasure?
JUMIN,Both.
JUMIN,"It’s an important event, so I must leave."
ZEN,That dude….
ZEN,There’s something seriously wrong with him;;;
MC,"Yup, a bit;;"
ZEN,Right right??
ZEN,He’s practically an alien.
MC,Since no one can be cooler than Zen ^^
ZEN,lolololol
ZEN,You’re making me blush;; lol
ZEN,^^
ZEN,"Oh, right!"
ZEN,I totally forgot about the Tripter bot
ZEN,because the hacker thing caught me off guard.
ZEN,I wanted to see what kind of photos were being spread around.
MC,"Hurry and check, haha. Don’t worry to much though. I’m sure they are all nice photos."
ZEN,I hope so;;
ZEN,"Jaehee said she’d search for it,"
ZEN,but she seemed really busy.
MC,Censorship please! Photos of you that are overly handsome are bad for my health! >_<
ZEN,Of course I have to delete photos that are harmful for the lady.
ZEN,But I don’t know id I can take back the photos that have already penetrated a lady’s heart…
ZEN,People seemed to have a hard time finding a way back out once they get into my photos…;;.
ZEN,"Anyways,"
ZEN,I’ll get going now.
ZEN,See you later!
707,If I put this here… okay! Finished.
Vanderwood,What the hell did you make while I was gone?
707,Huh? Oh. A cat robot.
707,I made it for protection… I couldn’t help myself after Jumin gave me the idea.
Vanderwood,"That’s for protection? The way I see it, it won’t be able to protect a single ant."
707,Oh… I know right? I made another useless thing again. What’s wrong with me? I guess I don’t value my life.
Vanderwood,I’m sorry to hear that. But my life is valuable. I should just sell you out to the boss and save my life.
707,"Yeah, go ahead."
Vanderwood,Go ahead? Are you serious?
707,…
Vanderwood,I’m getting tired of this now…
Vanderwood,RFA seemed to  be in a lot of danger… But you have to be safe first to protect that MC girl.
707,"… Yes. You know, Agent Vanderwood…"
Vanderwood,What?
707,I’m tired of your lectures.
Vanderwood,What!?
Vanderwood,"God… you’re such trouble. I was about to give you another lecture, but I thought I should at least tell you what the boss told me when I called him just now."
707,The boss?
Vanderwood,"Yes. As you know, this client is someone in the high ranks who not many people can even reach. They are asking why things are getting so delayed. The whole agency can be put under pressure right now."
Vanderwood,"If we delay things further, I’m not kidding, our lives might be in danger."
Vanderwood,The day is almost over and you haven’t even touched your work. They can’t wait any longer.
707,…
Vanderwood,"Are you listening to me, right now? This is an ultimatum. If you don’t finish things by tomorrow, your personal safety will be put under threat. Understand?"
707,"I know… I know, but… my head just can’t get around to that. What if the hacker gets to MC tomorrow…? I just have such a bad feeling about this…"
Vanderwood,"Feeling? What are you, a psychic? Hey, is your feeling more important, or your life!?"
707,You don’t understand…. You don’t know how anxious I am.
Vanderwood,Do you have feelings for that girl?
707,It’s not like that. I just want to help her be safe where she is. She’s… important to me.
Vanderwood,Did I hear something wrong? Important to you?
707,Huh?
Vanderwood,"Hey, don’t go there. You haven’t forgot that we don’t deserve to develop relationships, have you?"
Vanderwood,You can’t be responsible for her if she gets in danger because you involve her in your life.
Vanderwood,"Let’s just say you two start going out. If you end up getting a new identity after a big project, then you’ll be forced to never see her again."
Vanderwood,"And if you make a mistake in one of your missions, I’ve seen several clients harming the “important one” just for revenge."
Vanderwood,You know how filthy this field is.
707,I know… I know!
Vanderwood,"If you do, then don’t be an amateur. The minute you have something to lose, everyone you love will be in danger. We’re like a nameless time bomb. You have to make sure nothing is around so that less is harmed if you explode."
707,Time bomb…
Vanderwood,So just get rid of all your petty feelings and work. That’s the best thing you can do for that person.
707,…
Vanderwood,"You’ve done well until now. Don’t mess things up, Luciel."
Vanderwood,Make sure that my next target won’t be you.
707,MC…
707,It’s late. You’re still up?
MC,"Finally, you’re here."
707,Yes. Work kept me tied…
707,"MC, you can’t sleep?"
MC,"Yes! Seven, I was waiting for you~"
707,Me?
707,Oh… Were you waiting for me because you’re nervous?
707,I’m sorry.
707,I’m sure you must be so nervous about the hacker.
707,I’m sorry I can’t do anything more for your safety.
MC,I’m fine. I’m sure you have no choice. Did you talk to V yet…?
707,I tried…
707,But it seems V doesn’t have any service right now.
707,"But I left a voice message, so he’ll call me as soon as he hears it."
MC,What if something happens?
707,That’s… that’s what I’m most worried of…
707,"We have to be a team so that nothing like that happens, MC."
707,"All the RFA members, including you…"
707,must be careful for the time being…
707,Please… I hope no one gets hurt because I wasn’t good enough…
MC,You’re trying this hard. There’s no way that the members will be harmed. Don’t worry.
707,That’s… that’s not always the case….
707,You can say that because you don’t know much about me.
MC,Of course it should be like that.
707,Yes…
707,MC….
707,I don’t think I’ve told you much about myself.
707,what kind of work I do for the agency…
707,And dark things like that.
707,To be honest…
707,I wanted to show people in the RFA
707,only my bright and fun side.
707,Because the work I do is nothing but dark and filthy.
707,I didn’t want to tell anyone about that.
707,But…
707,now that this is happening… I feel like I should talk about it a little.
707,Because if anything happens…
707,if anything bad happens because of me…
707,you… and all the other members
707,will be in so much shock…
MC,I trust nothing bad will happen… but I want to know what you do.
707,"To be honest, the place I work for"
707,is a complete shithole
707,where even a mindless joke can get you killed
707,So it’s actually weird
707,for me to say that nothing bad will happen.
MC,Something bad? I hope that never happens.
707,Of course you’d feel that way.
707,So…
707,I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you this sooner.
707,The place I work for won’t think it’s weird
707,if someone dies this next minute.
707,I’m so sorry… that you got involved with me
707,when that’s the world I live in…
707,"It’s the only path I could choose, so I don’t want to whine about it."
707,But… I want you to know this.
707,"Nothing good will come out of you knowing,"
707,but I’m not a clean and bright person…
707,And
707,"since you can be put in danger because of me,"
707,we need to keep our distance…
707,"If we’re like how we are now, where we can’t meet"
707,"and you’re neither friend nor family, you’ll be safe."
MC,That’s… that’s so sad. We can even be friends?
707,I don’t know.
707,you and me…
707,did we ever have any kind of relationship?
707,We just talked a bit
707,here in this chatroom…
707,"And of course, I enjoyed all those conversation… but even those are pointless for me."
MC,I suppose I should keep my distance from you then.
707,Yes…
707,I’d appreciate that.
707,Since this is all for you.
707,You know…
707,"I only tried to laugh as much as I can in this chatroom,"
707,because of the dark place I’m really in.
707,This shithole… is probably the place that suits me best.
707,"I hope the members,"
707,"and especially you, aren’t harmed because of me…"
707,but I don’t know.
707,I’ll be more careful from now on.
MC,I would never have joined if I knew things would be like this…
707,I’m sorry…
MC,"Seven, think about yourself too, not just me. The more dangerous things are let’s stop being so sad."
707,You are always so kind.
707,I wasn’t wrong.
707,You are such a good person.
707,"You are so kind to everyone,"
707,"and even though you just found out about the RFA,"
707,"you fell for my ridiculous threat,"
707,and told us you’d help.
707,If I had just let you go then…
707,"told V that this isn’t right,"
707,convinced him to send you away…
707,you could have just deleted this app
707,and be free…
707,But it’s already happened now
707,so all I can do is be more careful…
MC,"I don’t regret getting to know you, Seven! Even if you do dangerous things!"
707,MC…
707,"Thank you,"
707,"but those words will have heavy consequences,"
707,so please be careful of what you say.
707,Please don’t think I’m such a good person.
707,"Of course,"
707,I’ll take care of everything that’s already happened.
707,I’ll try harder for you because I involved you in all this.
MC,Please just take care of it.
707,I’ll try to end it as fast as I can.
707,I’ll try harder for you because I involved you in all this.
707,"Whatever happens,"
707,I’ll make sure you’re never in danger.
707,but…
707,"once this hacker deal is taken care of,"
707,there’s something I have to do first…
707,so things might go a bit slow.
MC,What are you talking about? Of course you have to take care of the hacker first!
707,"Of course, my biggest priority is the hacker."
707,"But if the agency finds out about that, things might get more dangerous…"
707,so I’ll try to take care of it as fast as I can.
707,I’m sorry for confusing you.
MC,"Seven… you’re talking about the agency, right? Are you really okay… working there?"
707,"Don’t worry about anything, MC ^^"
707,"I’ll just go back to the Seven I always was, and come back after everything’s finished."
707,I’m sorry for being slow.
707,Please tell me
707,if anything strange happens
707,while I finish up my agency work.
707,"Alright, MC?"
MC,Won’t it be too late once I realize something strange is going on?
707,That… that won’t happen.
707,I’ll do everything I can.
MC,"Okay, don’t worry. I’ll be fine."
707,I really hope so…
707,^^
707,I have to go now.
707,I plan to finish the agency work in a blink of an eye.
MC,Just go and work.
707,"Yes, just wait a bit more."
MC,"Don’t feel so much pressure, and just take cate of everything one by one! Be careful, Seven. Thank you for protecting me."
707,I don’t deserve to be thanked.
707,I should be the one to be sorry.
707,I’ll come back soon. Take care of yourself.
707,Then… Good bye.
JAEHEE,MC… and
JAEHEE,Yoosung…
MC,Wassup Yoosung ma homie
YOOSUNG,Uh…
YOOSUNG,"Haha, guess you watched Straight Outta comfy or something."
JAEHEE,I’m sure she’s kidding.
YOOSUNG,"Hahaha, but that made me a bit cheerful."
JAEHEE,*…e.e*
JAEHEE,Emotions usually go more rampant at night.
YOOSUNG,Is that why?
MC,"Hello, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Yes… It is very late.
YOOSUNG,MC
YOOSUNG,Did you read what Seven said earlier…?
YOOSUNG,Isn’t it a bit sad?
MC,Yes… I feel really sad.
JAEHEE,I was quite surprised too.
MC,Maybe he just got super sentimental or something;;
YOOSUNG,I don’t think so;;
YOOSUNG,T_T I’m shocked.
JAEHEE,"To summarize his words,"
JAEHEE,"because he is a dangerous person with a dangerous job,"
JAEHEE,he needs to keep his distance from you…
YOOSUNG,How can he work where a meaningless joke can cost him his life?!
MC,"If that’s really the case, shouldn’t we go rescue him?"
YOOSUNG,Yeah!
YOOSUNG,"I don’t know what I’ll be able to do,"
YOOSUNG,"but if he’s in danger, I have all the intention to go help him!"
JAEHEE,It’s quite difficult to say since we don’t know the details…
MC,Nah~ He must be joking.
YOOSUNG,How can you see that as a joke? T_T
YOOSUNG,"I don’t think you really know Seven, MC…"
JAEHEE,He has never said anything like that all the time we’ve worked together.
YOOSUNG,"I used to feel so close to Seven, but now he’s so distant."
JAEHEE,One thing is for certain.
JAEHEE,The work Luciel does for the agency
JAEHEE,is not working out very well.
MC,Perhaps that’s why he was so crestfallen and described it that way.
YOOSUNG,Yeah.
YOOSUNG,then I understand.
YOOSUNG,I felt as if…
YOOSUNG,he lost confidence…
YOOSUNG,of what he does.
MC,Was he usually bad at his work?
YOOSUNG,Not at all!
YOOSUNG,Nothing like this has ever happened!
JAEHEE,I feel bad.
JAEHEE,Is there anyway we can help him…?
MC,Let’s get him some fried chicken.
YOOSUNG,Yes to fried chicken!!!
JAEHEE,Will he let a delivery guy into his home? When a joke can cost him his life…?
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,Then never mind T_T
MC,Let’s just let him take care of it himself.
YOOSUNG,Hmm… T_T
MC,Why don’t we bring him Honey Buddha Chips?
YOOSUNG,"My mother said,"
YOOSUNG,"that if one continues to eat junk food like Honey Buddha Chips,"
YOOSUNG,one will have only sodium in one’s body and die early of a heart attack.
JAEHEE,It’s nice to see you caring about your health.
YOOSUNG,It’s all because of my mom; ;
YOOSUNG,Can I point a super important fact right now?
YOOSUNG,I did say this before…
YOOSUNG,but the fundamental reason why Seven is so unstable right now
YOOSUNG,is because of MC.
MC,I just think he needs more sugar in his body.
YOOSUNG,haha
YOOSUNG,I did hear that low sugar levels will make it hard for you to work.
JAEHEE,That may be the case but…
MC,Oh…
YOOSUNG,I think he’s on edge because you’re not safe when he has feelings for you.
JAEHEE,I agree.
JAEHEE,That is probably why he is obsessing over the CCTV.
MC,I do think he is overly worried about me.
JAEHEE,He did stop doing his work to make a puppy robot;;
YOOSUNG,Ya.
YOOSUNG,This must be the first time Seven’s been this distracted over someone!
MC,He should be worried;; I’m in danger right now;;
JAEHEE,Your safety must be top priority.
JAEHEE,But ge must be trying not to worry too much that he cannot work at all.
YOOSUNG,Ya.
YOOSUNG,That’s exactly what seven is like right now.
YOOSUNG,I never thought there would come a day where Seven is so depressed.
JAEHEE,What gets to me more is
JAEHEE,what he said about something bad happening because of him.
MC,What do you think he meant by that?
JAEHEE,I don’t really know.
JAEHEE,We will have to hear more from Luciel
JAEHEE,concerning this.
YOOSUNG,Yeah…
MC,Maybe he did something super bad without us knowing;;
YOOSUNG,No way…!
JAEHEE,I hope nothing like that has happened.
JAEHEE,Just for Luciel’s sake.
YOOSUNG,He’s the one who always keeps us safe.
YOOSUNG,I doubt he’d ever put us in danger;;
YOOSUNG,I’m more worried about him now!
JAEHEE,"Yes, I am as well."
JAEHEE,"I think you will be safer if you stay with your mother, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,Why are you talking about my mom now? T_T
MC,Secretly go game when your mom hoes to bed lolol
YOOSUNG,I already did! lololol
YOOSUNG,I waited the whole day for her to go to bed!
MC,"You’re not playing games right now, right? lolol Good boy."
JAEHEE,"Yes, it must be so nice to be with your family ^^"
YOOSUNG,Noooooo
YOOSUNG,^^;;
YOOSUNG,Mom went to bed early so I secretly played LOLOL.
YOOSUNG,lolololol
YOOSUNG,I’m kind of a coward
YOOSUNG,"so I only played for like 30 minutes,"
YOOSUNG,but it was way more thrilling doing it in secret.
JAEHEE,Were you that desperate to play…?
MC,You could try to stop yourself when your mother’s there with you;;
YOOSUNG,I did stop myself~
YOOSUNG,I usually play three hours. lol
MC,I show respect because of your passion.
YOOSUNG,"Passion is passion,"
YOOSUNG,but I had withdrawal symptoms;;
YOOSUNG,But Jaehee.
YOOSUNG,What iy gifjkd
JAEHEE,?
YOOSUNG,ih
YOOSUNG,oh
YOOSUNG,no
YOOSUNG,mom just made a noise.
YOOSUNG,thank god she’s not awake
JAEHEE,;;;;
YOOSUNG,"If she finds out that I’m on my phone this late,"
YOOSUNG,she’ll make me make soap tomorrow;;;;
MC,lolololololol Make soap! So I can give them to Seven.
JAEHEE,Do you think that will make him feel better…?
YOOSUNG,Don’t say that.
YOOSUNG,I don’t want to make soap with my mom~!
JAEHEE,"If you end up making some, please give one to me."
YOOSUNG,…
MC,Just sleep tight like a good boy~
YOOSUNG,I will T_T
YOOSUNG,I’ll have to go.
JAEHEE,Sure ^^ Get back to being a good boy.
YOOSUNG,Bye.
YOOSUNG,T_T Talk later when Seven comes back.
JAEHEE,See you later.
JAEHEE,Gosh…
JAEHEE,I can’t get used to how quiet it is with Mr. Han out of the country.
JAEHEE,And Luciel’s sudden change in attitude is also hard to get used to…
MC,He’ll get better in the morning I guess.
JAEHEE,I hope so.
MC,He seems to have lost his confidence. I hopes he gets it back soon.
JAEHEE,I wish so too.
JAEHEE,Although it’s not in my place to interfere in his life.
JAEHEE,A change like this can’t be good.
JAEHEE,What agency do you think he works for…?
JAEHEE,"When I first joined the RFA,"
JAEHEE,"I looked everywhere for information on Luciel,"
JAEHEE,but I couldn’t find anything…
JAEHEE,"I’m sure it’s because he works for a secret intelligence agency, right…?"
MC,"If he has a dangerous job, I’d like to stop him…."
JAEHEE,"Yes, I suppose…"
JAEHEE,"He always seemed to finish work effortlessly, so I never thought work would get in the way…"
MC,"It’s a bit suspicious. You don’t think it’ll harm us, right?"
JAEHEE,"Although Luciel may seem playful, he always does his job."
JAEHEE,He will never put the members in danger.
JAEHEE,I’m more worried about Luciel putting himself in danger.
JAEHEE,But nothing will come out of us worrying.
JAEHEE,Why don’t you go to bed?
MC,Good night.
JAEHEE,"Yes, have a good night…"
JAEHEE,Seven will protect you.
MC,You’re right! You should go to bed.
JAEHEE,You must be tired as well. Please go and rest.
JAEHEE,It’s important to get enough sleep every night.
JAEHEE,Then I’ll get going.
JAEHEE,Have a comfortable night.
ZEN,MC! Hey!
MC,"Zen, what were you doing so late at night? ^^"
ZEN,I was taking some selfies;;
ZEN,"but I guess because it’s late, my face didn’t come out as good."
ZEN,I guess my camera has to rest at night haha
MC,Hello.
ZEN,"MC, you weren’t sleeping?!"
ZEN,"I was taking selfies, but my jaw line isn’t coming out as good."
ZEN,I had hoped;;
ZEN,Am I bloated or something?
MC,You’re really puffy;;;
ZEN,lololol
ZEN,You think?
ZEN,T_T
ZEN,I should cut out the carbs lolol
MC,"No, the photo is dazzling."
ZEN,Well;;
ZEN,That’s true lol
ZEN,Since a bit of swollen face doesn’t hide my beauty.
ZEN,"But I guess it’s because I’m an actor, I’m sensitive to the slightest changes."
ZEN,"That’s that,"
ZEN,Jaehee and Yoosung seem to worry about Seven…
ZEN,"To be honest,"
ZEN,I actually
ZEN,looked for the Tripter bot that Seven managed.
ZEN,lol
MC,So it really exists?
ZEN,Yeah lol It does.
ZEN,And it’s super active lololol
MC,Did you find it?
ZEN,Ya. I did.
ZEN,Even I was surprised;;;
ZEN,Where the hell did he find all my photos lololol
ZEN,That dude!!!
ZEN,Did he hack into my hard drive!?
ZEN,Huh!!??
ZEN,If he did…
ZEN,then good job~^^
MC,Isn’t this against privacy laws?
ZEN,Are you worried for me? ^^
ZEN,It’s okay because I’m fine with it lolol
MC,"Yeah, good job ^^ Our proud God Seven!"
ZEN,lolol Even I had fun looking at it.
ZEN,All the photos had such appropriate comments lolol
ZEN,I can’t tell if this is really just automated lololol
ZEN,Oh a shirtless photo of me after a workout session
ZEN,there’s a comment…
ZEN,OMG~! Look at Zen’s shoulders! He’ll hit passerby with them >_< My heart is exploding!
ZEN,"Now, hearts exploding can’t be good…"
ZEN,Haha…
ZEN,I don’t know if Seven actually wrote this lolol
ZEN,"On the selfie I took during practice when I was sweating all over,"
ZEN,he seemed to have borrowed a line from Hamlet;;
ZEN,"Oh my dear heart, to die or not to die after looking at Zen’s dazzling smile is the question."
ZEN,Everyone! Let’s look at Zen’s face and go to heaven!
ZEN,Comments like these are everywhere lolol
ZEN,And a different photo is posted everyday
ZEN,with completely different comments;;
ZEN,How the hell did Seven make this?
MC,He’s a genius. What can’t he do? lol
ZEN,Yup.
ZEN,"I’ve kept looking at it,"
ZEN,and I even almost forgot
ZEN,that Seven created this lol
MC,I think it’s just kind of useless…
ZEN,Nope haha
ZEN,It wasn’t useless. He did it for me.
ZEN,"I haven’t gotten any new roles, but I did get a lot of modeling jobs thanks to this."
ZEN,Seven… that boy. I’m actually touched.
ZEN,This Tripter
ZEN,reminded me of a high school girl who was madly in love with me.
MC,Give something back if you’re so thankful lolol
ZEN,you’re right~
MC,Look through all the photos. Make sure nothing weird’s on there.
ZEN,Thanks for worrying lol
ZEN,There are too many for me to go through
ZEN,but I trust Seven lololol
ZEN,The only flaw is that some comments are too cringeworthy;;
ZEN,but I should give something back.
ZEN,Hmm… What if…
ZEN,I give some love & career advice
ZEN,to Seven?
MC,I think Jumin will give better advice.
ZEN,Omg;;;
ZEN,"MC… you haven’t been brainwashed by him already, right?"
ZEN,"I have much more love experience than that dude,"
ZEN,and concerning life experiences… he’s a trust fund kid and I’m a self-made musical actor.
ZEN,In that sense…
MC,Good idea!
ZEN,So you admit I’m an expert too lol
ZEN,"If Seven is working on dangerous jobs, then I’d like to advise him to escape as soon as possible."
ZEN,Life will only become more difficult
ZEN,if you get trapped in your own world…
MC,I agree with that.
ZEN,Right?
ZEN,I want Seven to be healthy on the inside too.
ZEN,Solitude can eat you up inside…
ZEN,Oh… this was actually a cool line lol
ZEN,"While I’m at it,"
MC,What’s wrong with being alone? I like it.
ZEN,Omg!
ZEN,Really?
ZEN,It’s so hard for me to be alone…;;
ZEN,"Anyways,"
ZEN,"to give him some love advice,"
ZEN,I want Seven
ZEN,to be more honest
ZEN,about his feelings towards you.
ZEN,Hahaha
MC,Why do you keep tying us together?;
ZEN,Omg
ZEN,"MC, you don’t really like Seven…?"
ZEN,I can’t believe I was wrong…
MC,Yeah… I want Seven to just honestly express his feelings for me…!
ZEN,"Good girl, MC!"
ZEN,You seem much more honest.
ZEN,Seven never stops talking
ZEN,"when you’re joking around,"
ZEN,"but once you start talking about feelings, he’s just not there. lol"
ZEN,"Anyways, let’s stop talking about Seven. lol"
ZEN,"Looking at my photos on Tripter,"
ZEN,I wish I’d worked harder on taking good selfies. lol
ZEN,"It is quite difficult,"
ZEN,but I should take a selfie while taking off my shirt.
ZEN,I wonder what comment Seven will add to that photo lololol
ZEN,If I dare to make a recommendation…
ZEN,What’s dangerous isn’t this handsome face. It’s what you’ll imagine will happen afterwards ^^
MC,Oh!!! That trip will give me a heart attack!! I hope Seven cheers up and posts it soon.
ZEN,lololol Good ingredients are bound to produce good results.
ZEN,I should try it while changing my clothes before I go to bed.
ZEN,Make sure I get that six pack.
MC,Haha….
ZEN,God~
ZEN,Isn’t it just exciting thinking about it? lol
ZEN,I’m so creative! lol
ZEN,The perfect package lololol
ZEN,I can’t wait for the next Tript.
ZEN,I feel like I’ll get another modeling job if that photo goes out.
ZEN,I hope I get a new role along with it.
ZEN,Hahaha
ZEN,Hmm…
ZEN,I’m craving a cig thinking about a new role.
ZEN,But it’s bad for my skin!!!
MC,You can… no… you can’t…yes…no….
ZEN,"Hahaha, You’re having more trouble deciding I see."
ZEN,"I don’t want a lady to go through a dilemma this late,"
ZEN,so I’ll just stop myself.
MC,No smoking! It’s bad for your skin and your lungs.
ZEN,I shouldn’t wight;;;??
ZEN,Then I’ll have to eat something.
ZEN,"I miss a lady’s lips, but I can’t,"
ZEN,so maybe I’ll get some marsmallows.
ZEN,When are you going to bed?
MC,I’m going to do something before I go to bed ^^
ZEN,"Haha, go through my photos?"
ZEN,Don’t spend too much time on it.
ZEN,I heard somewhere that
ZEN,"if you watch a movie or a photo just before you go to bed,"
ZEN,you dream about it in your sleep.
ZEN,"Good night, MC."
MC,Right now.
ZEN,Alright.
ZEN,Don’t think about going through my photos
ZEN,and just go to sleep.
ZEN,Alright?
ZEN,Then I’ll get going~
ZEN,Good night ^^
707,Hi hi hi hi MC
MC,Hello.
707,I’m a bit sleepy.
MC,"Hello, Seven… Are you okay?"
707,Good morning.
707,But…
707,Zen;; it’s not good for his voice to smoke;
707,Good morning ^0^
MC,Jumin! How’s the middle east?
JUMIN,Good morning.
JUMIN,It’s still very early here.
707,Oh!
707,Mr. Director in the middle east!
MC,Hello.
JUMIN,"How are you, MC?"
JUMIN,It’s still very early here so it’s dark.
707,Are you drinking wine in the middle east too?
JUMIN,Yes.
707,"It doesn’t taste like oil, does it?"
JUMIN,Wine is made out of grapes.
707,Okie…..
JUMIN,Don’t be ridiculous.
MC,Bring me some wine when you come back.
JUMIN,I’ll choose the finest. I can give it to you at the party.
JUMIN,"Seven, are you doing okay?"
MC,Seven… is everything you said last night true?
JUMIN,Right.
JUMIN,People seemed worried last night.
707,Saw it lol
JUMIN,Is everything you said last night true?
707,Ya?
JUMIN,You had no choice but to choose a shit hole where a meaningless joke can cost you your life.
707,Oh….lolol
JUMIN,And
JUMIN,something bad might happen because of me so we have to keep our distance.
707,Haha
707,Time!
707,Don’t take that so seriously.
707,Something…
707,something bad just happened and
MC,"Well, if it’s nothing serious then okay."
707,So cool lol
JUMIN,So we can just ignore it?
707,Ya.
707,To tell you the reason…
MC,Something bad? Tell us.
707,"Just as everyone thought,"
707,"work wasn’t going so well, and I felt frustrated and upset. That’s why I said those things."
707,But!!
707,more
707,than
707,anthing
707,else
707,"once the moon goes up,"
707,people get super sentimental…
707,Like the late night sentimental syndrome or something like that…
MC,What’s that?
707,It’s when you get super sentimental looking at stars at night
707,and send your friends weird texts lolol
MC,Oh! I know what that is lolol
707,Oh!! Knew it lolol
707,Zen gets it time the time.
JUMIN,I’ve never heard of it.
707,It exists.
707,I just had it last night…
JUMIN,Don’t you think what you were overly serious to just put it at that…?
707,You can’t ignore the power of stars.
707,Detonator for your sentimentality!
707,Bang bang!
JUMIN,Oh.
JUMIN,There is this saying.
JUMIN,The moon is so beautiful that people are enraptured by it.
JUMIN,So…
JUMIN,A man intoxicated by the moon
JUMIN,went up the roof to grab it.
JUMIN,And then…
707,he died?
JUMIN,Yeah. He fell.
MC,…I want Seven to live a long life.
707,…Okie….
707,I’ll have to be careful.
707,Excessive sentimentality
707,ain’t good.
MC,My safety is under threat right now! It’s not the time to get all sentimental!
707,Good point!!
707,I’ll keep that in mind.
707,I’ll get my shit together and keep an eye out!
JUMIN,How trustworthy.
JUMIN,Do you both know?
JUMIN,"That in the desert, dawn is breathtakingly beautiful?"
707,Guess it’s easier to get sentimental there. lol
707,Don’t climb up the hotel roof!!
JUMIN,I can’t do that and leave Elizabeth the 3rd behind.
JUMIN,And there isn’t a roof per se.
JUMIN,"I have a great view where I can see the desert horizon,"
JUMIN,and the sunrise is extraordinary.
707,"lolol If it’s so pretty, then send us a photo~!!"
MC,You can see the desert from your room…? Jealous.
JUMIN,"I don’t think a photo will do any justice,"
JUMIN,but MC seems to want to see it so I’ll give it a go.
JUMIN,Wait a minute.
MC,Ya. Gimme gimme.
JUMIN,Should I…?
707,Ya.
707,I wanna see it meow!
JUMIN,Alright.
707,Hurry up!
JUMIN,Wait a sec
707,Drum roll please!!!
707,Louder!!
707,lololol
MC,So pretty….
707,Oh my god
707,It really makes you want to travel to the moon…
MC,I prefer reality.
707,I see… haha
707,It’s good that you’re satisfied with reality ^^
MC,Yes… Let’s make a spaceship so that we can go to the moon some day.
707,Oh…! That sounds fun! haha
707,I’m always up for adventure!
707,And Jumin will be our investor.
JUMIN,I must tell Assistant Kang to research the cost of creating a spaceship.
707,Yup.
JUMIN,Even if it’s not the moon
MC,What floor are you at? ;;
JUMIN,"Well, I haven’t asked."
JUMIN,"There are a lot of buttons in the elevator, so there is an elevator boy."
707,So luxe~ Jealous~
707,people get super sentimental…
JUMIN,What a beautiful sight.
707,I wanna go to the desert some day haha
JUMIN,Why don’t you plan a holiday trip after you’re done with your current work?
707,Hmm…
MC,"Let’s go somewhere together, Seven ^^"
707,I love holidays.
707,I would like to take a proper one
707,once this is over haha
MC,I don’t think this is the time for you to be thinking about holidays.
707,Holidays are inside my mind…
707,"They don’t exist in reality,"
707,just in my mind T_T
JUMIN,The work you’ve been doing for the agency didn’t seem to go so well… are you doing better?
707,Well… lol
707,"It’s fine that the agency work isn’t working out,"
707,but I don’t have enough time to work for the RFA…
707,That’s what’s hard…
MC,"I think you have too much work, Seven. Is there any way we can help you?"
JUMIN,I though so too.
MC,Can’t you just postpone the work for the agency?
707,"I’d like to,"
707,but then I might never get to work for the RFA again T_T
707,I just have to finish it as soon as I can.
JUMIN,"Or,"
JUMIN,why don’t we find other people to search for the hackers that are after the RFA?
JUMIN,It seems we’ve given you too much work.
707,That won’t be possible;
JUMIN,Why not?
707,"The RFA has a lot of classified information, and since I wrote all the programs,"
707,the new person will end up spending all his time
707,figuring out the program I created.
JUMIN,I see. Have you talked to V?
707,No.
707,I can’t reach him.
707,I hope we can talk to him soon;;;
MC,"Seven, you’re too dependent on V."
707,I can’t just decide everything for the RFA T_T
707,I know you must be frustrated. Sorry… T_T
MC,Why is V so hard to reach?
707,I think he’s still abroad T_T
707,Somewhere without any service…
707,I left a voice memo
707,so he’ll call me as soon as he sees it…
JUMIN,V…
JUMIN,"Considering how hard it is to reach him, he might be in the middle of a desert."
707,"Ya. If you see him through the window, make sure you get him."
JUMIN,I will.
707,"If I could, I wish I could clone myself"
707,and just do everything at the same time…
707,Why is it so damn hard to concentrate? ;;;
707,Maybe my body needs more vitamins because all I’ve been eating is Honey Buddha Chips.
MC,Jumin! Give some advice to Seven~
JUMIN,Should I?
707,Yup.
MC,HB Chips are good but it’ll ruin your health~!
707,Oh no~!
707,Alright lol
707,I’ll order something haha
707,Mr. Director!
707,I have a favor to ask.
JUMIN,?
707,Tell me
707,how to focus without thinking about anything else
JUMIN,Hmm…
JUMIN,Alright.
707,Oh!!!
707,Gimme ur secrets!!
JUMIN,Kill all your emotions.
707,I see…!
JUMIN,"Before I work, I start getting rid of all my petty interests and emotions."
JUMIN,"If you work for the sake of someone else,"
JUMIN,you can’t help but think about that person.
JUMIN,It breaks your concentration.
707,That’s exactly my state!!
MC,Who in the world is keeping you from focusing ? T_T
707,MC.
JUMIN,You are quite honest.
JUMIN,"So, you do have feelings for MC?"
707,I’m just worried about MC’s safety.
707,That’s it!
JUMIN,Then listen carefully.
MC,You can’t focus because of me lol
707,What? No
707,No yes
707,Yes no
JUMIN,"…Anyways,"
JUMIN,I’m going to be harsh here.
JUMIN,"If you can’t focus, you can’t help anyone."
JUMIN,You will end up not as the problem solver but the wandering idiot.
707,Wandering idiot…
707,But you’re right;;
707,"If I don’t get rid of my emotions and focus, then I won’t help anyone T_T"
JUMIN,Right.
JUMIN,"Wasn’t I much more helpful than Zen,"
JUMIN,and with his useless stories?
MC,"Jumin, you’re the man."
707,Ya.
707,So right.
JUMIN,"Yes, I am superior."
MC,"I think Zen will be more helpful, Seven~"
707,lololol
JUMIN,People have different opinions.
JUMIN,I respect it.
707,Knew it!
707,Mr. director
707,knows how to respect!
707,"In that sense,"
707,can I make a suggestion?
JUMIN,?
707,What you said just reminded me of this.
707,I want to invite the leader of the Emotional Labor Organization “Only Cry”
707,so that Mr. Director can expand his emotional horizons.
707,I heard that “Only Cry” is super good at knowing exactly what’s troubling you
707,and helping you just burst out crying!
707,"Once you’ve exploded with emotions after meeting Only Cry,"
707,"your emotions might actually disappear, haha."
JUMIN,I’m fairly good at suppressing my emotions by myself.
JUMIN,I’m not very interested…
JUMIN,but he seems like an interesting person.
JUMIN,Why don’t we invite him to the party?
707,Yup! Good idea lololol
MC,Good! Let’s invite him.
707,lololol I’m glad I’m helping.
707,I should tell him~ lol
MC,I don’t know. I’m not very interested.
707,T_T
JUMIN,"Elizabeth the 3rd is calling me, so I must leave."
707,Elly..
707,is calling for you?
JUMIN,She is quite desperate.
JUMIN,She is crying for water.
707,"Oh, okie lol"
MC,Take care~
707,Laterz
MC,Oh… I understand the beauty of water.
707,"Oh, you understand? I knew you’re my one and only rocket astronaut!!"
JUMIN,What an odd way of expressing your feelings.
JUMIN,Then I must get going.
707,He left haha
707,"I will consider Jumin’s rational advice,"
707,and Zen’s emotional advice
707,"to finish work and come back,"
707,is what I want to say…
707,but I suddenly smell something stinky…
MC,Is it Ms. Vanderwood?
707,B
707,I
707,N
707,G
707,O!!!
707,The smell of Ms. Vanderwood coming back!!!;;;
MC,Is it because your room is dirty? ;;
707,Nah.
707,"My room is super clean,"
707,so I can actually smell it more clearly.
707,This stink… means that Vanderwood is coming back…!
707,"I’d like to talk more,"
707,but I have to leave before she gets here T_T
MC,Huh? You can’t be here if she’s with you?
707,Nope.
707,Seven Zero Seven
707,"is a man of darkness,"
707,so don’t try to find out more!
707,She’s getting closer!
707,Time to leave T_T
MC,Go. And good luck!
707,YA.
707,I’ll come back
707,after I finish!!
707,Seven is leaving the chatroom!
707,Over and out!!
YOOSUNG,MC! Hey!
MC,How are you doing with your mom? ^^
YOOSUNG,Oh… well… uhm…
YOOSUNG,Haha
MC,"Hello, Yoosung~"
YOOSUNG,Hey!
YOOSUNG,But…
YOOSUNG,Seven’s maid…
YOOSUNG,stinks…?
YOOSUNG,"Jaehee, hello!"
MC,"Jaehee, how is work going?"
JAEHEE,Thank you for asking.
JAEHEE,I’ve been doing very well now that I don’t have to think about cats.
YOOSUNG,"Yup… wherever you work, the best day is when your boss isn’t there!"
JAEHEE,"Haha, that’s work life for you."
MC,"Hey, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,Hello…
JAEHEE,I just read about the maid’s smell.
JAEHEE,"But MC, are you doing okay?"
YOOSUNG,Oh yeah! Since MC’s the only one who doesn’t have bodyguards…
MC,I’m fine. Seven’s protecting me ^^
JAEHEE,I’m glad to hear that.
YOOSUNG,"Still, don’t forget to be careful!"
MC,"I am nervous, but there’s nothing I can do."
YOOSUNG,Hmm… I’m sure this will all be over soon!!
JAEHEE,"Yoosung,"
JAEHEE,did you get to school safely?
YOOSUNG,"Oh,"
YOOSUNG,"I have class in the afternoon,"
YOOSUNG,so
YOOSUNG,I’m going to school in MY VAN. lol
JAEHEE,Oh… I see.
YOOSUNG,I feel like a total movie star lololol
JAEHEE,I’m glad you seem to be feeling good.
YOOSUNG,Everything’s fine except for the fact that I’m a bit sleepy~!
MC,"You didn’t play games all night, did you? lolol"
JAEHEE,Of course not.
YOOSUNG,Well….
JAEHEE,What?
YOOSUNG,Haha ^^;
MC,Why are you sleepy?
YOOSUNG,Well…
YOOSUNG,After I left the chat room last night I was really going to just sleep…!
YOOSUNG,"But I couldn’t, so I kinda raged all night"
YOOSUNG,desperately hoping she wouldn’t wake up;;
YOOSUNG,I fell asleep at 4…
YOOSUNG,"and as soon as it turned 7,"
YOOSUNG,my mom and the body guards teamed up to  wake me up ^^;;
JAEHEE,"I first thought that Mr. Han was wrong to call your mother,"
JAEHEE,"but seeing the situation, I think he did what is right ^^"
YOOSUNG,Huh? T_T why would you say that!
MC,I think Yoosung’s passion should be respected.
YOOSUNG,MC gets me! haha
JAEHEE,I don’t know.
JAEHEE,I think it’s more of an obsession than a passion.
MC,I agree with Jaehee…
JAEHEE,I will be blunt here.
JAEHEE,"Unless you aim to be a pro-gamer,"
JAEHEE,stop playing so much.
YOOSUNG,;;
JAEHEE,You will get nothing by putting so much time and effort into it.
ZEN,two guys and two gals
ZEN,perfect lol
JAEHEE,Hello ^^
MC,"Hello, my rainbow unicorn."
ZEN,Huh? ;; What’s up with you haha
ZEN,Well lololololol
ZEN,"If everyone in the world is a horse, then I am a unicorn hahaha"
YOOSUNG,.
JAEHEE,Nice analogy.
ZEN,I think so too.
MC,Hello.
ZEN,Hey ^^
YOOSUNG,Zen! T_T
YOOSUNG,Jaehee thinks that Jumin did a good job
YOOSUNG,calling my mom.
ZEN,lol Are you tattle telling?
YOOSUNG,Yup.
ZEN,I hate everything that jerk does
ZEN,"but if you get to school on time because of your mother,"
ZEN,then that’s good lol
MC,Shouldn’t Yoosung be free?
YOOSUNG,Yeah!
YOOSUNG,Give freedom to Yoosung Kim!!!
YOOSUNG,All you squares go away!
ZEN,lololol
MC,I agree.
YOOSUNG,Omg
YOOSUNG,Everyone’s so square!!!
YOOSUNG,What’s wrong with gaming?
ZEN,square lololol
ZEN,Yeah fine… I’m square.
JAEHEE,What are you talking about?
JAEHEE,"If Zen is square, then I don’t know what I am, a double square? ;;"
ZEN,What-
ZEN,uhgh geod!!!!
YOOSUNG,"Zen, typo…."
ZEN,"Because of that jerk, I’m stuck and ca n barely m ove!"
MC,Are you okay?
ZEN,Yeah I’m fine!
ZEN,Sorry for the typos lol
MC,You can’t because of Jumin? Are you cursed or something…?
JAEHEE, I did see him read a book on dark magic…
ZEN,No;;
ZEN,That’s not it
ZEN,I’m moving in a van right now
ZEN,and the bodyguards are so big
ZEN,that I can’t move my arms!
YOOSUNG,Omg….
ZEN,They’re sitting right beside me and I feel like I’m being taken to the police station;;;
YOOSUNG,Omg that’s so sad T_T
JAEHEE,;;;Why don’t we switch body guards?
ZEN,No newed;; It’ll be oeveter soon. Don’y carreb bout it
YOOSUNG,lololol you have more typos thena me
ZEN,bno i don’t
JAEHEE,"Zen, where are you going?"
ZEN,So abouerth that
ZEN,I couldn’t stop thinking about my cigs
ZEN,so I’m going to a smoking quitting group.
JAEHEE,Smoking quitting group?
MC,Uhm… I need help too.
YOOSUNG,woooow
JAEHEE,I am amazed at your honesty.
ZEN,We’d have so much fun together!
ZEN,We can both quit and I’ll get to see you!
ZEN,That doesn’t sound too bad.
MC,I’m disappointed that my unicorn smokes cigarettes.
ZEN,I’m trying to quit
ZEN,because my unicorn glow can’t fade away~
ZEN,"Don’t be so disappointed, okay?"
ZEN,^^
MC,Life is short.
ZEN,Yeah… that’s what the group leader said.
ZEN,"You feel like your cigarette burns to quick, right?"
ZEN,It’ll be the same for your life.
YOOSUNG,That’s scary;;
ZEN,Yup… Got goosebumps.
YOOSUNG,"Honestly, it’s time for you to quit lolol"
ZEN,"Yeah. I thought my skin was getting worse because of a lack of sleep,"
ZEN,but i think smoking is worse for it
JAEHEE,"I think you have the clearest skin to be honest,"
JAEHEE,but I am all for getting rid of potential danger for your skin ^^
ZEN,Hmm;;
ZEN,Why does everyone say that my skin is so good? ;
ZEN,I don’t think so.
YOOSUNG,You always notice your own flaws more lolol
ZEN,"Oh, I see;;"
ZEN,I started when I was in high school because I thought it was so cool
ZEN,but I’m really going to quit this time.
ZEN,An actor should take care of himself.
ZEN,Only then can my fans think of me as their role models lolol
JAEHEE,You are absolutely right.
ZEN,The reason why Seven’s maid stinks is because
ZEN,a maid isn’t really a role model.
ZEN,So everyone thinks it’s weird lol
YOOSUNG,Oh…
JAEHEE,Why do you think Seven’s maid smells strange? ;;;
YOOSUNG,Well…….
MC,Maybe she smokes too?
ZEN,Can she? lolol
JAEHEE,Usually they can’t.
MC,"I mean, it’s Seven’s maid. Of course she’s strange too."
ZEN,Yup…. She can’t be that normal.
JAEHEE,"But if it’s Seven’s maid,"
JAEHEE,I’d believe it if she flies around in brooms;;
YOOSUNG,There are several types of people in this world.
JAEHEE,I really hope we find out what kind of person she is.
YOOSUNG,"Let’s not think too much about it,"
YOOSUNG,and acknowledge that people are diverse…
ZEN,You’re right lol
ZEN,Even jerks like Jumin are human…
YOOSUNG,lol
YOOSUNG,Why are you suddenly mentioning Jumin? lolol
JAEHEE,If I can say something here…
JAEHEE,"If you’re in the position of getting paid,"
JAEHEE,you can’t help but simply accept the strange things your boss does ^^
MC,"To be honest, I don’t like that he told Seven to just get rid of his emotions."
ZEN,"If you’re a human being,"
ZEN,you can’t ever get rid of all your emotions.
ZEN,Except that dude who’s practically a robot!
MC,Jaehee’s being honest;;
YOOSUNG,Is that what happens if you start working…?
JAEHEE,That’s what most companies are like…haha I’m sure there are good places though.
ZEN,I just hate guys who think they know it all -_-
ZEN,Jumin that jerk…
ZEN,Get rid of all your emotions before working… Look at the advice he gave to Seven.
ZEN,What the hell does he know? lol
MC,I think Jumin is cool.
ZEN,"Jumin, cool…?"
ZEN,But he told Seven to get rid of all his emotions!
JAEHEE,Well…
JAEHEE,It does sound like something Mr. Han would say.
YOOSUNG,Is that even possible?
ZEN,It’s not for me.
ZEN,How can I get rid of emotions when I’m acting? lolol
JAEHEE,I’m sure that’s the case for you Zen…
ZEN,"Is it possible for you, MC?"
MC,I can’t get rid of my emotions.
ZEN,Yeah exactly.
YOOSUNG,Yup.
YOOSUNG,I’m still sad that I can’t play LOLOL…
MC,I can control my emotions however I want lol
ZEN,Wow! You must be psychic lolol It would be so comfortable to act if you can control your emotions lolol
YOOSUNG,"Wow, so cool! A superpower!"
JAEHEE,"Yoosung, do you believe everything people say?"
YOOSUNG,Oh… She doesn’t have a superpower?
JAEHEE,-_-
ZEN,lololololo Why are you so naive? lolo
ZEN,You think this is the game world right now?
YOOSUNG,T_T
JAEHEE,"To be honest,"
JAEHEE,"for people like us, it’s more efficient to suppress our emotions as much as I can when working."
YOOSUNG,Jaehee T_T
ZEN,The world doesn’t appreciate the importance of human emotions.
ZEN,And on top of that the world is full of bastards like Jumin!!
YOOSUNG,omg lolololol
ZEN,Just arrived at the quitting smoking group.
ZEN,"I just thought of this,"
ZEN,but I think it’ll be nice to invite them to the party.
JAEHEE,The group?
ZEN,Their full name is “Quitting Smoking Challengers” lol
ZEN,I think there will be some people who want to quit smoking~
MC,"Yeah, it’s a good cause! Let’s invite them."
ZEN,Then I’ll talk to them once the meeting is over.
ZEN,I heard someone wrote a book on the 118 ways to quit smoking.
ZEN,They will definitely be helpful.
MC,Hmm…. I just hate cigarette smoke.. I’ll pass.
ZEN,"If they want to quit smoking they won’t… but if you don’t want to, alright."
ZEN,Pass!
ZEN,Then I’ll get going.
ZEN,"Yoosung, pay attention in class, ok? ^^ Jaehee, hang in there!"
JAEHEE,Thank you. Enjoy your meeting.
ZEN,"MC, be safe, alright?"
MC,"Okay, don’t worry. Hope the meeting goes well."
ZEN,Thanks.
ZEN,Bye!
MC,Good bye.
ZEN,bye ^^
YOOSUNG,Zen~ See you later!
YOOSUNG,Get rid of your emotions when working…
YOOSUNG,Do you think Seven really needed that advice?
MC,He might have a problem controlling his emotions. But isn’t the fact that he’s in a difficult situation what’s really getting to him?
JAEHEE,Yes…
JAEHEE,But we can neither track the hacker for him nor change his job…
JAEHEE,I don’t think it’s bad for him to clear his head and focus for a while.
YOOSUNG,Hmm..; So you agree with Jumin.
YOOSUNG,I honestly don’t know;
MC,Who cares? It’s all fine as long as the work is done.
YOOSUNG,T_T That’s true…
JAEHEE,"When you work for a company, regardless of the means, results are usually what counts."
JAEHEE,"It may sound harsh, but that is often the case."
YOOSUNG,That’s a bit sad T_T
JAEHEE,People change
JAEHEE,once they start working…
YOOSUNG,Even the smile is sad T_T
YOOSUNG,But
YOOSUNG,I’m already
YOOSUNG,at school now.
YOOSUNG,The people outside are taking out their cameras!!!
YOOSUNG,I guess rumors got around that I’m a celebrity;;;
JAEHEE,"That’s a false rumor, so you will have to clear that up."
YOOSUNG,I’m basically a celebrity in LOLOL!
YOOSUNG,I would have put on a face mask or something if I knew my photos were going to be taken lol
MC,It would have been good if you slept early lolol
YOOSUNG,That’s hard.
YOOSUNG,LOLOL is like my oxygen.
MC,You can’t be a celebrity in real life. I guess why not be one in LOLOL?
YOOSUNG,"Considering what’s happening right now,"
YOOSUNG,I might become one in real life!!!
JAEHEE,No you won’t.
YOOSUNG,"Maybe tomorrow, I should wear a scarf."
JAEHEE,"…Yes, alright. So go to your class before you’re late."
YOOSUNG,Yup!
YOOSUNG,I’ll get going!
MC,"Bye, celebrity boy."
YOOSUNG,"I’m not a boy, but that does sound good."
YOOSUNG,"I’m sleepy, but I’ll hang in there~"
YOOSUNG,See you later!
MC,Don’t fall asleep.
YOOSUNG,I’ll try…;;
YOOSUNG,See you later!
JAEHEE,Seven’s Tripter bot…
JAEHEE,I forgot to mention that.
JAEHEE,You saw what Zen said I assume?
MC,"Yes, I think Seven did a very good job."
JAEHEE,"I looked through it after Zen found it,"
JAEHEE,and I should follow it.
MC,Yeah. It was a bit embarassing to look at though.
JAEHEE,Perhaps because the photos were too great.
JAEHEE,They will become better if you take your time.
JAEHEE,Now I have to prepare for when Mr. Han gets here
JAEHEE,and finish things in advance.
JAEHEE,I desperately hope
JAEHEE,that he doesn’t come back with another cat project idea ^^
MC,I hope that doesn’t happen….
JAEHEE,I desperately hope so….
JAEHEE,I’m scared that he might talk about a desert tour program for cats.
MC,I think that’s likely lol
JAEHEE,"Even if he mentions another strange project,"
JAEHEE,"if he is too busy… I’ll be able to live, right? haha"
JAEHEE,"It was nice talking to you, MC."
JAEHEE,Have a good day…
MC,Good bye… Good luck! ^^
JAEHEE,^^
MC,Good bye.
707,?!
707,"Vanderwood, didn’t you hear something just now?"
Vanderwood,I didn’t.
707,I heard someone laughing… Did you laugh?
Vanderwood,Haha. Happy?
707,That’s not the voice…
Vanderwood,Of course not. Do you think I have the time to laugh right now? Just go back to work.
707,…I definitely heard something.
Vanderwood,"If you tell me that you’re hearing things and start making a fuss, I’ll taser you."
707,"Uhm, uh….."
707,I guess I was just tired.
707,Agent.
Vanderwood,"I said, shut it."
707,Can you give me some coffee? The one over there
Vanderwood,That? Wait.
Vanderwood,What? It broke… The handle just broke off.
707,…
Vanderwood,"I just cleaned up your room, and now I have to do it all over again. Damn it."
Vanderwood,"Hey, don’t mind this and just work. I’ll get you new coffee."
Vanderwood,Don’t even think about getting out of that chair.
Vanderwood,"If you move, we both die."
707,Okay…
Vanderwood,"You look dead. You’re not worried about getting jinxed because this cup broke or anything like that, right?"
707,"No, no."
707,···Probably not.
JUMIN,MC.
JUMIN,"It’s still early here, but I hope you had lunch"
MC,Not yet.
JUMIN,Oh no… I hope you don’t skip it for the sake of your health.
MC,I did ^^
JUMIN,Good.
JUMIN,A regular and balanced meal greatly helps your health.
MC,I don’t have enough money to get lunch.
JUMIN,….
JUMIN,Is that so?
JUMIN,Just… tell me if I can help…
JUMIN,I’m playing golf soon with the oil prince.
JUMIN,They built a golf course in the desert.
MC,Oh! That’s genius!
JUMIN,I think so too.
MC,In the desert? ;;;
JUMIN,I think it’s a fantastic example of putting the land to good use.
JUMIN,Except for the one flaw that the course disappeared five hours after it was built.
JUMIN,The oil prince says that all his guests hated the desert course…
JUMIN,but I think it’s very valuable.
JUMIN,Today… will be the day I pour out my soul to true golfing.
JUMIN,So in that sense…
JUMIN,I thought of a good idea.
JUMIN,I’ve always had a complaint about grass golf courses.
JUMIN,The shots fly too clean and the game ends too quickly.
JUMIN,"Oh, of course,"
JUMIN,that only applies to skilled players like me.
MC,"You’re good at golf? Nice shot, Mr. Director~"
JUMIN,I’ve played ever since I was young.
JUMIN,"Nice shot, Mr. Director…"
JUMIN,"is very cliche, I don’t want to heart it."
JUMIN,My father is very good too.
MC,You want to build gold courses on desert too?
JUMIN,I’m thinking about it.
JUMIN,A hardcore course course in the barren desert
JUMIN,where you play with your life hanging on the line… That sounds nice.
JUMIN,I wonder who will win if I play golf with my father in the desert.
JUMIN,Hmm.
JUMIN,It seems nicer the more I think about it…
JUMIN,"If you swing your club while surrounded by the desert wind, won’t all your stress just disappear?"
JUMIN,"I can tell Assistant Kang to acquire all the necessary documents,"
JUMIN,and I’ll have to meet with a golf clothing company as soon as I arrive.
JUMIN,Since we’ll have to create a functional golf clothing line customized for playing in the dessert.
JUMIN,I’m thinking of inviting them to the party as well. What do you think?
MC,Good! Let’s invite them.
JUMIN,So far things are going smoothly then.
JUMIN,Then I’ll have to think about creating a golf clothing line for cats as well.
JUMIN,I will be very happy to take them to the desert field.
JUMIN,deserts are dangerous to humans… but it’s where the cat ancestors were born.
MC,I think they’ll be a bit boring to invite to the party…
JUMIN,Really?
JUMIN,"Well… yes, they will just be talking about business."
JUMIN,I will respect your opinion.
JUMIN,Oh.
JUMIN,The prince is calling me.
JUMIN,I’ll come back when I get another idea.
JUMIN,"Take care, MC."
MC,Good bye.
JUMIN,Alright.
JUMIN,Make sure you eat.
JUMIN,Good bye.
MC,Win the game ^^
JUMIN,I plan to give him his way.
JUMIN,If the desert allows me to do that…
JUMIN,Then see you later.
Vanderwood,You’ll slide down from the chair sitting like that.
707,This is comfortable.
Vanderwood,You haven’t been typing for 3 minutes in that pose.
707,"Alright, alright."
Vanderwood,You seem to not know the severity of the situation because you’ve only heard rumors about our client. So let me tell you.
Vanderwood,You know the X-Pile?
707,Yeah. Isn’t it our competition company that disappeared a few years ago? That small intelligence agency.
Vanderwood,Yeah. You know why that agency disappeared?
707,I am not interested.
Vanderwood,Because they didn’t meet this client’s deadline.
707,How late were they?
Vanderwood,You’ll faint once you hear this.
Vanderwood,…1 minute.
707,What?
Vanderwood,The whole company was turned into smoke because they were a minute late. All the hackers from there are still missing. I heard recently that one was living in Africa and has a limp.
Vanderwood,That client is being exceptionally generous to us right now.
Vanderwood,You get it?
707,I want to quit this job.
Vanderwood,Don’t be ridiculous. his is the only place that will hide your identity.
707,Mahababamitabul
Vanderwood,Hey… are you listening to me?
707,Namuamitabul Hanshimbayabaramitdasi jokyon ohgo plzhelp
Vanderwood,"Hey, are you chanting to Buddha right now? You’re catholic!"
707,I’m trying to concentrate. Leave me alone.
707,Sariza sebisgood bullybead lifemathzhard
Vanderwood,…I’m gonna go out for a smoke so please get back to work.
707,"Sariza followtehelaw neverendinglife impobentnot… Huh, she left!"
707,Hate that she’s always watching me.
707,I really feel bad about this… I’ll just check the server while she is gone.
707,The RFA server… hmm… nothing wrong here…
707,And the CCTV feed looks fine…
707,"The apartment security server… server transparency ok, input output okie dokes, last activation of gate security system… good."
707,And… the special security system…
707,Huh…?
707,The numbers seem to be different. Am I seeing it wrong…?
707,"Access log…! Oh, here it is. The last log…"
707,was only a couple hours ago.
707,Last night it was restarted and reset… someone broke in two days ago…
707,Someone hacked in and changed the system… Shit…!
707,This has the most complicated algorithm of all security systems….
707,"Sent emails, sent alerts… the hacker who led MC to the apartment… and this record…"
707,Someone is active all over…
707,They must all be the same person.
707,Oh! MC!
707,She’ll be in danger!!
707,MC!!!
MC,Gahh! Why are your texts so big?
707,I’m sorry.
707,But it’s that important
707,so listen to me!
MC,Yes? Why? Is something wrong?
707,I can’t explain in detail
707,but you’re in danger right now
707,From this second
707,Don’t ever move from the apartment.
707,Something really bad might happen!!!
MC,What???
707,I’ll explain when I get there.
707,I’ll go there right now so just stay still!
MC,I told you I’m safe.
707,I’ll explain everything when I get there.
707,So
707,Until I get there
707,DON’T EVER
707,MOVE!!
707,There’s a problem with the apartment security system right now.
707,I’m gonna go and fix it.
MC,You’re coming here?
707,Yes.
707,I’ll do whatever it takes to get there
707,so just trust me…
707,God;;
707,I have to leave right now because of Vanderwood…
707,I’ll come back
707,so just trust me and hang in there!
MC,What the hell is this!?
707,Just don’t move.
707,Promise!
MC,"Seven, wait!"
707,Sorry
707,I have to go.
707,Just hang in there!
YOOSUNG,MC…
YOOSUNG,What in the world is Seven saying?
YOOSUNG,Something bad might happen to you?
MC,I don’t know… It sounds really urgent…
YOOSUNG,I was so surprised while reading his text
YOOSUNG,that I just burned my tongue while eating goldfish-shaped bread;;
MC,There’s no way I can know since he didn’t explain anything… I’ll just have to stay here.
YOOSUNG,It sounded really urgent…
YOOSUNG,What in the world do you think is happening?
YOOSUNG,I was so surprised that I burned my tongue while eating goldfish-shaped bread T_T
YOOSUNG,My mom would have given me a lecture for that if she were here.
YOOSUNG,Wait wait;;
YOOSUNG,That’s not what’s important…
YOOSUNG,What in the world is happening…? ;;
MC,"I’m not sure, but I can tell that he’s super conscious of Ms. Vanderwood being there."
YOOSUNG,I know!
MC,I said I don’t know.
YOOSUNG,MC… I’m sure it’s frustrating;;
YOOSUNG,"But,"
YOOSUNG,do you really think that Ms. Vanderwood is his maid?
YOOSUNG,Why does he talk as if he’s sending messages behind her back?
707,MC
707,Yoosung
YOOSUNG,Seven!
MC,"Tell me why I can’t leave this place, Seven."
707,I don’t have time to explain.
707,I’ll go so talk later.
MC,Seven! What were you talking about just before? Please explain.
YOOSUNG,Yeah!
YOOSUNG,"Seven, what’s going on?"
707,Tell you later
707,"MC, just wait a bit more"
707,"First, contact Jumin"
707,tell him it’s an emergency
707,Tell him that Rika’s apartment’s
707,‘special security system’
707,has been hacked.
YOOSUNG,What?;; What the hell is that!??
707,I can’t talk much right now
707,tell him to contact V
YOOSUNG,Alright.
YOOSUNG,"MC’s okay, right?"
707,I’m gonna go save her
707,Don’t worry
707,I have to leave
707,"Yoosung, please do whay i said thx"
YOOSUNG,Gahh…;;;
MC,Seven’s coming here right now?
YOOSUNG,"Yeah, I think so."
YOOSUNG,This must be really bad for Seven to act like that…
MC,I’m getting nervous…
YOOSUNG,Me too….
YOOSUNG,It must be a real emergency right now…
YOOSUNG,What in the world T_T
YOOSUNG,"First, I should talk to Jumin just like what Seven said."
YOOSUNG,What do you think the special security system is? ;;
YOOSUNG,God…
YOOSUNG,Seriously;;
YOOSUNG,"He didn’t explain a thing,"
YOOSUNG,but just made us nervous;;;
MC,Yeah. What is he thinking? ;;
YOOSUNG,I promised my mom that I’d read the whole book today;;
YOOSUNG,I can’t focus at all!
MC,I think he doesn’t have any other choice right now. I should just listen to him and wait.
YOOSUNG,You really do trust him.
YOOSUNG,I’m a bit nervous…
YOOSUNG,but I’ll do whatever Y can for the members.
YOOSUNG,"If Sherlocking were here,"
YOOSUNG,he would have figured everything out
YOOSUNG,with those tiny clues;;
MC,Is he famous? Can I have his contact information?
YOOSUNG,Why? To invite him to the party?
YOOSUNG,I’ll tell him to email you!
MC,Will he really help though…? ;;
YOOSUNG,You’re right…
YOOSUNG,Seven is on it right now
YOOSUNG,so we shouldn’t really think about calling an outsider.
YOOSUNG,MC…
YOOSUNG,"I’m sure you must be nervous, but Seven will be there soon, so just wait."
YOOSUNG,Oh!
YOOSUNG,Just heard the door open;;
YOOSUNG,My mom must be home.
YOOSUNG,"I feel bad leaving you alone right now,"
YOOSUNG,can I go hide the rest of my goldfish-shaped bread
YOOSUNG,and contact Jumin if I have time?
MC,"I’m fine. Hurry, Yoosung!"
YOOSUNG,Okay!
YOOSUNG,I’ll call Jaehee if I can’t reach Jumin
YOOSUNG,so don’t worry ^^
YOOSUNG,I’ll come back soon!
MC,"Okay, go.."
YOOSUNG,I’ll come back soon.
YOOSUNG,Be careful!
Vanderwood,"Yes, boss. No, that’s… yes! He was sick. I sincerely apologize."
Vanderwood,"We do have a hunch… no, we haven’t found evidence yet… I don’t know what to say. Yes, I’ve pressured him enough but it doesn’t seem to be working very well…"
Vanderwood,"What? No, but why don’t you give is at least until today?"
Vanderwood,"Yes, considering that he has always done well. Yes, you’re right. 707 is undoubtedly a very talented agent."
Vanderwood,Hasn’t he decoded the CSS in the shortest amount of time?
Vanderwood,"Yes, I’m sure you regret not giving him mental training because of his talent…"
Vanderwood,"We should have carried it out by force, I will take him there as soon as we finish today. He’ll come to his sense once we’ve given him a taste of what real torture is."
Vanderwood,What? No. We don’t have a puppy? What is this…?
RoboDog,Woof woof! The garage is a no smoking zone! No cigarettes! Useless person! Woof!
Vanderwood,…Where the hell did this come form?
RoboDog,I am God Seven’s creation! Woof! I was born in 150 BC when my mom dog robot met my Arabic father dog robot and with the contract from blacksmith Alababa…
Vanderwood,No wonder this thing is bullshit. it’s that useless crap that Seven made.
707,Alright…
707,Se-seven!!! Hey! Why are you here? And what the hell is in your hands!?
Vanderwood,Hey!! Why are you putting all our equipment in the car!?
707,Gahh! Caught me!
Vanderwood,And you thought you’d just leave without me noticing!?
RoboDog,I told you to take out that cigarette!!!! Woooooofff!!!!!
Vanderwood,Aaarggh! Why is the dog spitting out fire!?
707,"Oh! You can’t ignore that woof! Sorry, Ms. Vanderwood!!"
707,I have something to do. Bye~
Vanderwood,Se-seven!!!
Vanderwood,"I’m sorry, boss. Seven just got in the car and ran away…"
Vanderwood,"No, I don’t know what he is thinking, but he seemed to have taken all the hacking equipment with him."
Vanderwood,Yes. I doubt he will return and finish his work.
Vanderwood,What should I do? Should I chase him?
Vanderwood,What? Just stay here… and finish the work? Take care of Agent Seven afterwards…?
Vanderwood,Alright…
707,MC…!
MC,Seven! Are you on your way?
707,Yes.
707,I logged in because I thought you’d be nervous.
707,"Nothing happened, right?"
MC,"No. This isn’t just a mishap, is it?"
707,I’m glad that nothing happened…
MC,No… I’m fine ^^
707,Thank god…
707,"As I told you before,"
707,you can’t move from the apartment.
707,I’m on my way to you right now.
JAEHEE,Luciel!
JAEHEE,Yoosung told me.
707,Jaehee.
MC,Jaehee… Hi~!
MC,What the hell is the special security system!?
707,"I’d like to explain everything,"
707,but I really don’t have the time right now.
JAEHEE,Where are you?
707,"Oh… first,"
707,"Jaehee,"
707,have you talked to Jumin yet?
JAEHEE,He’s in a meeting in the middle east right now so he’s not taking his calls.
JAEHEE,I’ve left him a message so he will call me as soon as he is done.
707,"Alright. I’m driving right now,"
707,so I’ll come back when I arrive.
JAEHEE,"I was writing Luciel, are you okay? … but he just left…"
MC,This is really nerve-racking… but I’m a bit happy that he’s coming to protect me.
JAEHEE,I’m sure you feel that way…
JAEHEE,But I’m getting more nervous by the fact that Seven himself is on the move.
MC,Will this be solved by Seven coming here? ;;
JAEHEE,He’s not the type of person to just go there without any plans.
JAEHEE,"But,"
JAEHEE,what in the world is the special security system… Why is he being so anxious…?
JAEHEE,"Besides,"
JAEHEE,"there is something odd about how Luciel is heading over to your place, MC…"
JAEHEE,I feel as if he’s running away from someone… or is it just me?
MC,I do feel that too… but I hope he doesn’t get hurt trying to hurry.
JAEHEE,Yes… I agree.
MC,"Yes, isn’t it suspicious?"
JAEHEE,It’s not suspicious per se…
JAEHEE,I should pray for him.
JAEHEE,I hope it’s not a big deal…
JAEHEE,I will continue trying to reach Mr. Han.
MC,Good bye.
JAEHEE,Yes…
JAEHEE,Please trust Luciel even if you are nervous…
MC,"Okay, please let him know what’s going on, Jaehee!"
JAEHEE,Do not worry.
JAEHEE,I hope you are safe until Luciel gets there.
JAEHEE,Then I will get going. I will come back soon.
YOOSUNG,MC…
MC,"Yoosung, do you think Seven is safe right now? I’m worried."
YOOSUNG,I know…
YOOSUNG,I hope he talks to us soon…
YOOSUNG,"My mom is asking me what I want for dinner,"
YOOSUNG,and I can’t think of anything.
YOOSUNG,I hope we get back in touch with Seven soon and
MC,Is your tongue okay?
YOOSUNG,"Yeah, I think it’s fine…"
YOOSUNG,I’m so frustrated right now that I can’t even feel the pain
YOOSUNG,or think of anything.
YOOSUNG,I just hope Seven comes back to the messenger soon…
YOOSUNG,I hope he tells us everything that is going on.
JUMIN,Assistant Kang called me.
YOOSUNG,Jumin!
MC,Jumin! The special security system… did you get the chance to talk to V about it?
JUMIN,I’ve been trying to reach him but he hasn’t been answering for days now.
YOOSUNG,"Serious, V;;;"
YOOSUNG,I don’t even know what he’s responsible for now!
JUMIN,I agree.
MC,Jumin… you’re back.
JUMIN,"MC, you seem safe."
YOOSUNG,Seven is on his way so he’ll be okay.
YOOSUNG,But Jumin…
YOOSUNG,Did you talk to V about that special security system?
JUMIN,"I’ve been trying, but I only hear a voice message that he’s in an area with no service."
JUMIN,Where the hell did he go?
JUMIN,I wish I could send search parties to all the desert in the world.
YOOSUNG,;;;;
MC,"I feel like you really would be able to, so I don’t want to say anything;;;"
YOOSUNG,…Jaehee might faint if she sees this.
JUMIN,I’m half kidding.
MC,Hmm… V is so irresponsible.
YOOSUNG,It makes me so mad to think that he’s just traveling around when all this is happening!
JUMIN,No one expected this to happen.
YOOSUNG,But leaders exist to take responsibility of unexpected things like this!
JUMIN,That’s true.
YOOSUNG,What the hell is the special security system?
YOOSUNG,I’m dying to know!
MC,"I want to know too. Jumin, do you know anything?"
JUMIN,I don’t know for sure… but I can guess.
YOOSUNG,Then let me hear it!
JUMIN,Do you remember what I said before?.
JUMIN,That there was a group who wanted our guest information from a previous party?
YOOSUNG,Yeah… so you said we tightened the security system.
JUMIN,I think it’s that one.
YOOSUNG,I guess.
MC,Wouldn’t it probably be a system that protects the apartment?
JUMIN,I suppose.
YOOSUNG,You said that last time!
YOOSUNG,That there was a group who wanted our guest information from a previous party…
YOOSUNG,Maybe it’s a security system that protects the information?
JUMIN,I think so too.
YOOSUNG,If that system was hacked…
MC,Aaargh! My head is so jumbled right now.
YOOSUNG,I thought my mom coming would be the worst thing that could happen to me…
JUMIN,"So from what we know so far, we can guess that"
JUMIN,someone hacked into the security system to take the information that’s in MC’s apartment.
YOOSUNG,Is that it!?
MC,then someone must have hacked in to take our guest information…
JUMIN,We can’t rule out that possibility.
YOOSUNG,Then doesn’t that mean that MC’s in danger right now!?
MC,So that’s why Seven is hurrying to see me…
YOOSUNG,I think so!
MC,Oh my god… But nothing says that I’ll be safe when Seven gets here;;
JUMIN,We don’t have evidence but…
YOOSUNG,MC!
YOOSUNG,I know you must be dead nervous right now but I think it’ll be good to trust Seven…
JUMIN,All we can do is wait until Luciel gets to the apartment and talks to us.
JUMIN,The address is secret so I can’t even send additional guards there.
YOOSUNG,"Seeing that Seven is still keeping his secret with V in this emergency,"
YOOSUNG,he must be seriously loyal to V;;
JUMIN,But can you call that loyalty…?
YOOSUNG,"If the address weren’t a secret,"
YOOSUNG,I would have gone there right now to help with whatever…
JUMIN,"Although V may not be there,"
JUMIN,I’ve canceled the rest of my plans with the oil prince and I’m heading to the airport right now.
JUMIN,I’m taking the first flight back home.
JUMIN,There may be something I can do…
YOOSUNG,You’re way better than V!
MC,"I feel bad that your schedule’s messed up now… Anyways, be careful…"
JUMIN,No need to worry about me.
JUMIN,Worry about your safety first.
MC,Come here asap and do something.
JUMIN,"There won’t be anything I can do right away even if I get there, but…"
JUMIN,I’m getting an international call.
JUMIN,I won’t be able to take it once I’m on the plane…
JUMIN,I have to go.
YOOSUNG,Alright…
YOOSUNG,Be careful.
JUMIN,"MC, I sincerely hope you’re safe."
JUMIN,"And Yoosung, take care of yourself and your mother."
YOOSUNG,"Okay, I will."
YOOSUNG,OMG
YOOSUNG,RIGHT
MC,You feel bad that he’s leaving?
YOOSUNG,No!!!
YOOSUNG,That’s not it.
YOOSUNG,I wanted to yell at him for calling my mom
YOOSUNG,but he left T_T
MC,Wasn’t it Jumin who called your mother~?
YOOSUNG,AAARGGH!!
YOOSUNG,I should have
YOOSUNG,complained to Jumin!!!
YOOSUNG,"Well, we’re in an emergency,"
YOOSUNG,so I won’t have time to yell anyways…
YOOSUNG,Uh.
YOOSUNG,I hear my mom coming;;;
YOOSUNG,She’s coming…
YOOSUNG,…
YOOSUNG,….
YOOSUNG,Well this is fantastic.
YOOSUNG,My mom wants me to help her cut onions T_T
YOOSUNG,It’s gonna make me cry….
YOOSUNG,I wanna cry… haha
MC,Good bye…
YOOSUNG,Okay…
MC,Have fun peeling onions…. Adios.
YOOSUNG,Gahh… I should sing while I peel them.
YOOSUNG,If I cry…
YOOSUNG,then my voice might sound super sad.
YOOSUNG,Never mind lol
YOOSUNG,She’ll give me a slap on the back for being noisy if I do that.
YOOSUNG,I’ll get going.
YOOSUNG,"MC,"
YOOSUNG,everything will be fine! Don’t worry too much.
YOOSUNG,Be safe until I come back!!
YOOSUNG,I’ll be back T_T
Notification,The special security system will be acti- acti- act… act….
MC,(Looks at where the announcement is coming from.)
MC,(Ignores the announcement.)
MC,Thief!!!
MC,The hacker…!?
MC,What are you talking about? I’m not going anywhere!
MC,Is that place really paradise?
MC,Are you sure… that I will be happy?
MC,I’m not going anywhere!! Seven!! Help me!!
Notification,"act- act- act, act, act…"
Notification,The special security system has been deactivated.
707,"God, that was tough…. I made it, but it’s so damn hard. How the hell did they complicate my already complicated algorithm?"
MC,Seven!!!! Save me!!!!
707,MC!!!
707,"You’re the hacker, right? Guess you’re not completely shameless since you’re covering yourself. You’ll go to jail for breaking and entering like this. Whoah! You broke the window."
707,"MC, be careful of the glass. You’ll get hurt if you step on it."
707,"First, why don’t you let go of that lady over there?"
707,I hated that the agency made me go through physical training… but I guess it did help.
707,Huh? You know me?
707,No way…
MC,"Seven, do you know him?"
707,Oh… That’s…
MC,Seven! What’s going on? Tell me!
707,Uhm…
707,What… what happened?
707,"Why are you…! Why are you here!? You’re Saeran, right…?"
707,You’re the one who copied my algorithm…? God… when did you learn to hack!? Who taught you?
707,Why are you doing this!? Rika told me that you…
707,What?
707,Saeran…. why are you doing this now? Tell me!
707,"Something bad happened, right? That’s why you’re here?"
707,But Rika would never have lied to me…!
707,I’m not lying!
707,That… I had no choice! It’s all too much to explain now…
707,"Saeran, I don’t know what people told you… but I thought you were doing well."
707,I asked Rika to see a photo of you laughing. I knew I couldn’t meet you but I always prayed for you to be happy…
707,"First… let MC go, and then let’s talk. Please? Let’s take care of this together…"
707,"You hate me right now, right? She has nothing to do with this."
707,There’s no reason to involve her in this! Don’t do something to her because of me…. Please…!
707,"…Even if I do, it’s useless."
MC,Seven!!!! I love you!!!
707,Love? I guess you two were being lovey dovey when I shivered in my loneliness.
707,"That’s not it! MC, don’t move!"
MC,Let me go!!
707,MC! Stay still!
707,Don’t move. It’s dangerous.
707,Saeran… just take me instead!
Notification,A stranger has been located.
707,The special security system… I restarted it and it’s only starting to work now…
Notification,Sensed location of stranger… adjusting target…
707,"It’s sensing you as a stranger, Saeran."
707,The whole place will explode if we stay like this. Get out of here!
Notification,"Backing up all information… After the back up is complete, the bomb will be activated. 20 seconds left…"
707,We’ll all die if we don’t get out!!
707,MC!! Right now!!
MC,(Bite the man’s arm)
707,Good…! Come here.
Notification,10 seconds left… 9 seconds…
707,Saeran… why did we have to meet like this…?
Notification,6 seconds… 5 seconds…
707,Get out! You’ll die like this!
Notification,Sensing stranger’s movement… readjusting target… readjusting… readjusting…
Notification,Stranger missing… Stop attack. The special security system is now under lookout mode.
707,Thank god… it stopped.
MC,"I’m scared… Seven, hug me."
707,… I feel a bit disoriented right now. Will you give me some space?
MC,Seven… are you okay?
707,I don’t know… I don’t think both of us are okay…
707,God…
707,Shit…
MC,That man… how do you know him?
707,That man… is my twin brother.
707,…
MC,Can’t you stay for the night?
707,…Saeran….
707,I can’t believe it… Why is my twin brother…?
MC,Twin brother?
707,…Oh.
707,You shouldn’t have found out about this.
707,"MC, I’m sorry, but please keep what happened with that boy a secret."
707,"You can forget it completely… no, that will actually be better. Since that was a traumatic experience…"
707,Don’t tell anyone in the RFA about him… Please.
MC,Why should I? I think everyone has the right to know!
707,Because I don’t want to harm the other members.
707,"Now that I know the hacker is related to me, I want to take care of this by myself."
MC,"Alright. I’ll trust you, Seven."
707,Thank you.
707,"I’ll see the end to this for sure, so don’t worry."
707,I’m so sorry for putting you in danger.
707,I should… finish rebuilding the special security system here.
707,I brought my laptop and all the equipment… so I’ll stay here for that and for your protection. I don’t know what to say…
707,I have to change the whole algorithm… I have to use a completely new method so that Saeran can’t hack in again. It will take some time…
707,And… I have to ask this of you again.
707,Please… keep Saeran a secret so that no one else gets hurt…
707,Please.
707,MC…
707,"I thought you were sleeping, but you’re here."
MC,Isn’t it fun being here when we’re in the same apartment?
707,You know… our secret
707,from the members…?
MC,"Seven, I’ve been dying to know what you’ve been doing. Tell me~~"
707,I’m working.
707,"Even if you see it, it’ll be too hard for you to understand."
707,"And,"
707,"I never really told you about the special security system, right?"
707,"Everyone will be able to read it if I write it here, so I’ll explain."
707,The special security system…
707,was implemented to protect the information stored here.
707,"Thankfully the information is safe,"
707,and so are you…
707,so I’ll have to tell the members to stop worrying.
MC,"Seven, but what about your work for the agency? Can you be here?"
707,That’s… nothing.
707,"Don’t worry about me, and just take care of yourself first."
707,I can just work here.
707,Since you’re within my sight…
707,I’ll be able to focus now.
MC,I’m so happy that you’re here. We can be like newly-weds!
707,I’m sorry but I’m not interested in that.
707,I first have to take a look at the system again
707,so that you can feel safe.
707,"I’ll finish the work as soon as possible, so just bear with me."
ZEN,Seven!
707,"Hey, Zen."
ZEN,MC!!
ZEN,Are you okay?
MC,I feel so safe with Seven here… I feel like I have a husband.
ZEN,I guess you’re in a good mood.
ZEN,I’m glad that you feel safe.. so both of you are okay?
MC,"I’m fine, thanks to Seven."
ZEN,I’m glad that you’re safe
ZEN,"but Seven, you’re okay too!?"
707,Yeah. Sorry for making you worry.
ZEN,"I just went to a meeting to quit smoking, but I feel like I was on a different planet;;;"
ZEN,What the hell’s been happening?
ZEN,So that… special security system or something broke
ZEN,and you had to go to the apartment?
707,"Yeah, that’s it."
ZEN,Did you fix everything?
707,"Not all of it, but I’ve made temporary measures."
ZEN,My god;;;
ZEN,I can’t even shut my mouth;;;
ZEN,I have to be careful of my jaws… I’m an actor. It’s important.
MC,"Seven, how long do you plan to stay here?"
707,I’ll leave once I finish fixing everything.
ZEN,"Yes, yes."
ZEN,It’s a knight’s duty to protect the lady.
MC,"Seven, can’t you just stay here and protect me?"
707,"I’ll be here until I finish the work, so don’t worry."
707,And I’ll be your body guard.
707,I’ll protect you.
ZEN,"MC, you must have been so surprised."
707,Yeah…
ZEN,I knew it.
ZEN,I get surprised when my shower head breaks;;
ZEN,If the security system breaks? Ugh;;;
ZEN,I should send her a photo of me right now…
ZEN,but I don’t have one I like right now…;;; Should have taken some selfies.
707,Yeah…
ZEN,You’re reacting a bit strange?
707,Oh…
707,I just can’t relax because the hacker is still out there.
ZEN,Who the hell broke that security system!?
ZEN,Isn’t it the same guy who sent me that freaking email!?
707,It is.
ZEN,Yeah!?
MC,I think it was one person who did everything…
ZEN,What….
707,Yeah.
707,"It’s the same hacker who sent that weird alert, who first led MC to the apartment."
MC,I have no worries now though. Because my hubby❤ is right beside me.
ZEN,I’m glad that you’re with Seven…
ZEN,"but nothing like that should happen again, right?"
707,Don’t worry. I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen.
ZEN,"But… thinking about it now, it’s weird."
ZEN,"At first,"
ZEN,V said that
ZEN,the person who led MC to the apartment
ZEN,is probably someone related to Rika!!
707,Oh…
707,I think it’s someone completely different.
MC,Huh? But Seven… you told him… that Rika…
ZEN,What?
707,"Oh, it’s nothing."
707,I think MC is still in shock and getting things mixed up.
ZEN,Oh…
MC,"…Yes, I can’t talk about it now, but I think it’s someone else."
ZEN,Really?
707,Yeah… He can’t be Rika’s friend when he’s attacking us like this.
ZEN,That damn hacker…
ZEN,Why is he so desperate to have our guest information…;; Bastard.
707,The information may be what he wants…
707,or he can have something against one of our members…
707,we’ll have to wait and find out.
ZEN,But all our members are so nice! What’s there to hate? ;;;
ZEN,So then you know his address?
ZEN,You said you found out the IP address or something!
707,Yeah… but I can’t go right now.
707,"I have to make sure the special security system is safe,"
707,and I should do more research before actually going.
ZEN,"Yeah, you’re right…"
ZEN,Best to be prepared!
ZEN,They don’t seem like your regular haters;;
ZEN,I hate that I don’t even know what that guy looks like;;
ZEN,Can’t you just give me the hacker’s address?
ZEN,"If we just take all of Jumin’s body guards, I feel like we can pretty much beat up everyone."
MC,"Oh! That’s a good idea. Seven, this can all be over without you doing anything ^^"
707,No… It’s better that I take care of this.
707,"Besides, we don’t know what will happen if we’re nor prepared."
ZEN,"Hmm… I guess you know best, Seven."
MC,I don’t think that’s a good idea…
707,She’s right…
707,"Zen, let’s just wait a bit more."
707,We have to be careful as you just said.
ZEN,Yeah; That’s true.
ZEN,We don’t know what they might do when they feel threatened.
ZEN,"Anyways,"
ZEN,make sure you’re a good body guard to MC. Just stay with her 24/7!
707,I plan to.
MC,I trust Seven ^^ He’ll protect me.
ZEN,Okay! I’m glad you’re there for her.
ZEN,Just stick by her side so that even a fly can’t get to her!
707,Yup.
MC,24/7…! Just stay right beside me.
ZEN,Yeah! Stay super close to her!
ZEN,So that you two are always touching!
707,Oh.
707,I have to go take a shower now.
ZEN,"Everyone appreciates what you’re doing, Seven."
ZEN,Go ahead.
707,Yeah.
707,Then I’ll come back soon.
ZEN,Okay!
MC,"Honey, I filled the hot tub for you~"
ZEN,What? ;;
ZEN,Wait…
MC,"Thank you for everything, Seven ^^"
707,"No, I’m just doing what I was supposed to."
707,I feel bad about putting you in danger.
ZEN,"If you feel bad, then go take a shower, and guard MC with everything you have!"
707,Yup.
ZEN,Wait.
ZEN,Wait wait;;;
ZEN,But…
ZEN,"The hacker led MC to the apartment,"
ZEN,"and hacker led MC to the apartment,"
ZEN,"and hacked the RFA server or something,"
ZEN,and now he’s hacked into the security system
ZEN,which made Seven go and save MC…
ZEN,And now Seven is guarding MC by himself…
ZEN,"in the same house,"
ZEN,and now Seven is going to take a shower
ZEN,…
ZEN,Wait.
ZEN,Seven and MC…
ZEN,You two are going to be in the apartment by yourselves!?
MC,Yes… Why?
ZEN,Oh my god!!!!
ZEN,But you’re a woman and he’s a man!!!
ZEN,What… what did I say;;;;
MC,>_< Now you noticed?
ZEN,"MC, are you being glad right now?!?!?"
ZEN,But he’s a guy!!!
ZEN,Oh;;;;
ZEN,"Ok, calm down."
ZEN,Seven would never do that…
ZEN,He has nothing but pure intentions…!!!
ZEN,Haha
ZEN,hahahaha
ZEN,haha
ZEN,…
ZEN,"MC… it’s not that I don’t trust Seven or anything,"
ZEN,"but if something happens, tell me."
MC,"If something happens, then the more reason not to tell you anything~"
ZEN,Uhm.
ZEN,kj;iej
ZEN,My hand. Stiff right now.
ZEN,What do you mean something…
MC,Nothing like that will happen ^^;;; I trust Seven.
ZEN,Yeah… keep that faith…
ZEN,Hallelujah
ZEN,"No, what… anyways…"
ZEN,Tell him not to disappoint me.
ZEN,Jesus christ…
ZEN,I should go.
ZEN,I have to go clear my head… I’m gonna go through everything Seven has done so far.
ZEN,"If I stay here and talk to you,"
ZEN,I’ll only have inappropriate thoughts…
MC,"Good bye, Zen."
ZEN,I have to leave… but I can’t…
ZEN,MC… Men are genetically different from women…
ZEN,"Make sure to keep your distance, alright?"
MC,"Haha, nothing will happen, so don’t worry and go."
ZEN,"You say you’re fine, but all men are wolves!!"
ZEN,"Call me if something happens, alright?"
ZEN,See you later… Hope nothing changes about you…..
ZEN,I really hope so…
ZEN,…….
707,I’m sorry for barging in on your space.
707,I’ll just stay in the corner so don’t mind me.
MC,Come here~! Let’s stay right by each other’s side and eat.
707,Please… don’t talk to me like that.
707,I need to fix the security system and I need to focus if I want to find out more about Magenta.
707,"If you’re hungry, you can eat by yourself. Don’t care about me."
MC,I’m not uncomfortable at all. Just make yourself at home.
707,I feel better this way. I’ll just work here.
707,"I’ll stabilize the security system… and once I finish researching about that Magenta Saeran is at, I’ll head there right away."
707,"I didn’t want to be alone with you like this, but I guess the intruder left us no choice."
MC,"Still, you’re more reliable than a CCTV."
707,That’s true…
707,but don’t feel too safe about me. I don’t have a good reputation.
707,It might be more dangerous that I’m here.
MC,I like it. Just live here!
707,I don’t like it. You might be in danger if you stay with me.
707,My agency will track down this place… and take me away.
707,So you really have to take care of yourself.
MC,The agency… are you really okay with them? Are you being chased?
707,A little bit.
707,"but I’m the only one who knows the address to this place, so it’ll take them a long time to find me here."
707,I left my car someplace far because of that.
MC,Did you do something wrong concerning the agency?
707,That’s nothing for you to know.
707,"Don’t try to find out anything about the agency. If anyone asks, just pretend you don’t know anything."
707,"If I finish my work before I get tracked, I plan to disappear from the face of this earth…"
707,"Unless something happens, you’ll be safe."
707,"Anyways, my point is that I’m a dangerous person…"
707,So I’ll leave as soon as I can. Don’t try to get so close to me.
MC,But… you’ll be uncomfortable in that corner.
707,"I told you before, but this suits me better."
MC,"Well, you’re here anyways so we might as well get close! Come here~!"
707,I have to work.
707,And I feel uncomfortable with you talking that way. Please don’t.
707,"If you have a sharpie, I’m all for drawing a line on the ground."
MC,Oh come on~ Don’t be so shy~
707,please be careful of what you say.
707,"No, just leave me alone."
MC,Don’t you have anything you want to tell me… about your brother?
707,That’s nothing for you to know.
707,It was a mistake telling you about him… Just forget that I even mentioned it.
707,"I’m sure you have a lot of questions, but there’s nothing I can tell you right now… Just don’t ask me anything."
707,Maybe you should pretend I’m not here.
MC,Seven… you’re not like how you are in the chatroom.
707,Oh… you should never judge a person by how they are online.
707,Anyone can pretend to be brighter online. Especially more so for people like me.
MC,Are you really going to be like this to me?
707,The reason why I hurried over here was to protect you.
707,"I have no plans to pursue any sort of personal relationship with you, so know it as that."
707,I’m sorry if you had any fantasies about me.
707,"This is who I am, so just accept it. Don’t try to get close to me."
707,I’m going to start working now so don’t bother me.
JAEHEE,MC…
JAEHEE,Are you okay?
MC,Yes… I’m safe thanks to Seven.
JAEHEE,"I was very worried, but I’m glad the situation seems to be over for now."
JAEHEE,I feel much better that Luciel is with you.
MC,I’m fine. Don’t worry about me now.
JAEHEE,"Yes, I’m so glad that nothing happened."
JAEHEE,I really can’t hide how surprised I was.
JAEHEE,The hacker that led you to that apartment…
JAEHEE,the hacker who sent us that email…
JAEHEE,and the hacker who penetrated the security system are all the same person…?
JAEHEE,One thing is for sure. Someone is really after us.
JAEHEE,I’m sure it was very hard for Seven to just run straight away and stop the attack.
MC,I do feel safe with Seven here.
JAEHEE,I suppose Luciel’s talents are the only hope we have for now.
MC,The hacker let us meet. We are fate~ haha
JAEHEE,Fate?
JAEHEE,"I don’t know what your relationship with Luciel is,"
JAEHEE,but it’s quite amazing to see you recover so fast from the emergency.
JAEHEE,"Yoosung seemed very worried too,"
JAEHEE,but I think he can’t come here right now because of his mother.
JAEHEE,And Mr. Han is on a plane.
JAEHEE,Since you and Seven are together… I feel safe now.
JAEHEE,I thought that the CCTV wasn’t enough.
MC,"Anyways, how’s work going, Jaehee?"
JAEHEE,"Oh, thank you for asking."
JAEHEE,I was just about to go meet Mr. Han at the airport.
JAEHEE,He is scheduled to arrive early in the morning.
JAEHEE,"Oh, right."
JAEHEE,"Mr. Han wrote about a desert golf course earlier in the day,"
JAEHEE,but I suppose I should write down the cons before I go see him?
MC,You know what to do…
JAEHEE,"Yes, I’m quite getting used to being an assistant…"
JAEHEE,"Besides, working with Mr. Han"
JAEHEE,"has given me the habit of preparing for everything,"
JAEHEE,even things that no one else would even dare to imagine.
JAEHEE,^^
MC,Why? You should respect Jumin’s opinion!
JAEHEE,Yes…. Right….
JAEHEE,I wish Mr. Han would respect my opinion as well….
JAEHEE,I should get going as I have some things to prepare.
JAEHEE,"I suppose Seven won’t be getting any sleep fixing the security system,"
JAEHEE,but I hope at least you get a good night’s sleep.
MC,Good bye.
JAEHEE,"Bye, see you later."
MC,Thanks for worrying Jaehee. You cheer up too.
JAEHEE,"Yes, thank you."
JAEHEE,"Anyways, have a good rest."
ZEN,I can’t sleep;;;
ZEN,"MC, you’re here!!"
ZEN,Isn’t Seven that guy
ZEN,always saying or doing something weird?
MC,"He kept glancing at my pajamas earlier, do you think something’s up? ^^"
ZEN,WHAT?!
ZEN,Who cares about secrets?! Just give me the address!
MC,Don’t worry ^^;; Seven’s on our side.
ZEN,You still have to be careful!
ZEN,You don’t know when he’ll turn on you;;;
ZEN,All men are wolves.
ZEN,Seven is a man too…
MC,So should I be careful with you as well?
ZEN,"well… I mean,"
ZEN,I’m a gentleman…
ZEN,When the Sun’s up at least^^
JAEHEE,ha
ZEN,oh
ZEN,"Jaehee,"
JAEHEE,"MC, Zen…"
JAEHEE,You are both here very late.
MC,Did Jumin return safely?
JAEHEE,"He will soon. I’m actually at the airport now, waiting for his arrival."
ZEN,You’re at the airport right now?
JAEHEE,"Yes, I think he will be arriving soon."
MC,I was just having a lovely chat with Zen ^^
ZEN,Hahaha
JAEHEE,Lovely chat…
ZEN,I was just kindly warning her of the dangers of being next to a guy.
ZEN,"But,"
ZEN,"Jaehee, why are you up so late?"
JAEHEE,"Mr. Han is about to arrive soon, so I am at the airport to greet him."
ZEN,"Jaehee, you really don’t have a fixed work schedule;;"
JAEHEE,I’m already used to having to work whenever…
JAEHEE,but I hope I won’t have to write up a report on golfing in the desert.
ZEN,That trust fund jerk…
ZEN,"I mean, come on!"
ZEN,Look at the situation.
ZEN,You still think he’d care about that?
MC,I can’t wait for the desert golf project ^^
JAEHEE,"I apologize that I have to disappoint you,"
JAEHEE,but I plan to do everything it takes to stop that project from coming to life…
ZEN,Yup….
ZEN,People should plant trees not get rid of them!!
ZEN,A desert golf course? -_-
ZEN,His ideas always suck!!
MC,I think Jumin would still care…
JAEHEE,I agree…
JAEHEE,Mr. Han will go to work as per usual even when the sky comes crashing down.
ZEN,…
ZEN,If someone opens up his skull and studies his brain… I’m sure there will be something wrong with the part that’s responsible for emotions;;
JAEHEE,MC…
JAEHEE,I’m sure you are very nervous because of the hacker.
ZEN,I can barely sleep.
ZEN,It must be worse for you…
ZEN,"I hate that you are alone with Seven in that apartment,"
ZEN,but I can’t believe that the person who led you there is the HACKER!!
ZEN,"And it’s not just some any other guy,"
ZEN,he so freaking talented that Seven is up in arms!!
JAEHEE,I also would have been nervous if Mr. Han did not come back.
JAEHEE,The fact that RFA has enemies is nerve-wrecking.
ZEN,Ya…
MC,I wish we could reach V right now…
ZEN,"Yeah! That’s a bit of a different problem,"
ZEN,but even Jumin’s coming back home.
ZEN,Where the hell is he and why can’t we reach him? -_-
ZEN,God! So frustrating!!
MC,We would have been in big trouble if it weren’t for Seven.
ZEN,He really did good by going there to save you.
ZEN,I’m glad that you’re safe
ZEN,but it’s still a problem that there are a bunch of things that aren’t solved…
ZEN,Where the hell is V when all this is going on?
JAEHEE,This occurred to me since I’m at the airport…
JAEHEE,but it would be so nice if V would come out of the airplane landing right now…
ZEN,I’m disappointed that he still unreachable.
JAEHEE,Zen…
JAEHEE,"I understand how you feel but I am sure tat V isn’t picking up his calls on purpose,"
JAEHEE,so I hope you aren’t too upset with him.
ZEN,"Well, I know that…"
MC,Let’s wait a bit for him to reach us.
JAEHEE,Yes… Let’s give him more time.
ZEN,How much longer do we have to wait?
ZEN,Time is of essence right now… I honestly can’t help but get mad.
MC,I think V is being too irresponsible.
ZEN,Yup. Exactly what I’m saying.
JAEHEE,"If we knew something like this would happen,"
JAEHEE,he would not have gone traveling.
JAEHEE,He still has a very strong sense of responsibility.
ZEN,"If he is really responsible, shouldn’t he have at least given us a way to contact him? ;;"
JAEHEE,That’s true…
JAEHEE,"Nothing will come out of feeling upset,"
JAEHEE,so why don’t you try to calm down and think about it again?
JAEHEE,I’d like to stay longer but I must go see Mr. Han now.
ZEN,Yeah….
ZEN,I guess I should try to calm down.
JAEHEE,I will make sure to come here if something happens.
MC,"Jaehee, it’s late so please be careful and good luck!"
JAEHEE,"Yes, thank you for your concern."
JAEHEE,"Please take care too, MC."
MC,Please take good care of Jumin.
JAEHEE,Of course.
JAEHEE,"Now that he is back, I’m sure he will focus on RFA’s emergency."
ZEN,Be careful not to catch a cold.
JAEHEE,I will ^^
JAEHEE,Then I will get going first.
ZEN,See you later.
ZEN,I’ve never been this upset with V…
ZEN,"but right now, the trust fund jerk’s actually doing more than V."
MC,"I’m sure that if V knew what was happening, he would have taken care of it."
ZEN,Yeah I guess…
ZEN,"But,"
ZEN,things keep happening
ZEN,"without him knowing,"
ZEN,so it’s really frustrating -_-
ZEN,I don’t what’s happening to this world.
ZEN,"MC,"
ZEN,"Seven’s being good to you, right?"
MC,"He seems a bit busy, but he’s nice."
ZEN,I’m sure he was really surprised last night too.
ZEN,I don’t know the details but a super important security system got hacked.
ZEN,Make sure to comfort him a bit.
ZEN,And also to maintain your distance.
MC,I’m a bit disappointed that all he’s doing is work.
ZEN,Hahaha.
ZEN,Then just come here.
ZEN,I’ll always be here for you.
ZEN,I should go to bed now.
ZEN,"If something happens, don’t ever stay still, alright?"
ZEN,"And by “something” here,"
ZEN,I mean when Seven
ZEN,suddenly starts panting as if he’s run a mile~~!!
ZEN,Or when his eyes half close~!!
ZEN,Things like that.
MC,"I’ll be careful. Thanks for worrying, Zen."
ZEN,Yeah….
ZEN,I wish I could visit you in your dreams and protect you. lol
ZEN,Is that a bit too cheesy? lol
ZEN,"Sleep like a little baby lamb, MC."
MC,Good bye.
ZEN,"You too, MC…"
ZEN,Good night!
JUMIN,MC.
JUMIN,Hello.
MC,Hello.
JUMIN,How have you been?
JUMIN,"I’m not very worried since Luciel kept your side,"
JUMIN,but I can’t hide that I’d like to protect everyone more securely.
MC,Welcome home!!!
JUMIN,Thank you.
JUMIN,"I usually take a day or two off after I come back from a business trip, but I suppose I can’t today."
JUMIN,I feel so bad that I can’t rest.
JUMIN,I suppose it’s because I can’t secure the safety of everyone at RFA.
JUMIN,I’ve been thinking…
JUMIN,and I’d like to make a proposal considering how urgent the situation is…
JUMIN,And I’d like to hear your opinion.
JUMIN,"The address of your apartment is classified,"
JUMIN,but if the most sensitive security system got hacked… I can’t hep but be nervous even if Luciel is there.
MC,I don’t care since all I need is Seven.
JUMIN,I see that your trust towards Luciel is solid.
JUMIN,But good intentions can’t solve all the problems.
MC,I think we should discuss that issue with Seven.
JUMIN,Of course we should.
JUMIN,"We can’t do anything about V as he’s not reachable,"
JUMIN,but perhapsLuciel can reach a more rational conclusion as he know everything that’s going on.
JUMIN,I’d like you to talk about this Luciel soon.
JUMIN,Since he is responsible of managing classified information.
JUMIN,I trust that he as well realizes that a person’s safety is more important than keeping a secret..
MC,What is Elizabeth doing?
JUMIN,She’s sleeping right now.
JUMIN,"I’d like to sleep with her, but I doubt I would."
JUMIN,I should check my itinerary for the day.
JUMIN,I remember I have to have lunch with Father…
JUMIN,It’ll be nice if he doesn’t bring any woman to the restaurant.
MC,I guess you meet your father often.
JUMIN,"Yes, I suppose."
JUMIN,"Also, after every business trip, I meet Father for a meal to debrief him about the trip."
JUMIN,I suppose it’s one of my family traditions…
MC,"But why don’t you see any women, Jumin?"
JUMIN,"I see Assistant Kang at the office everyday, so technically, I do meet a woman."
JUMIN,But if you are referring to a girlfriend or lover…
JUMIN,"Seeing my father’s girlfriends is enough, so I have no curiosity for that sort of relationship."
JUMIN,"Anyways,"
JUMIN,I am quite excited to have a peaceful lunch with my father soon.
JUMIN,It’s a father and son tradition to have lunch every time I come back from a business trip.
JUMIN,I think Yoosung is having a good time with his mother.
JUMIN,I recommend he builds a new family tradition with his mother.
MC,That is a very nice idea.
JUMIN,You could think that I’m being nosy but thank you for saying so.
JUMIN,"There are various types of families these days, so diverse traditions must exist."
JUMIN,I hope his family is happy.
MC,Poor Yoosung…
JUMIN,It’s nice to set a day every month where he goes back home to have dinner with his family.
JUMIN,Talking with your family allows you to think about your future. And you get the chance to think about what living in society means.
JUMIN,I think it will help Yoosung as all he did was play games by himself.
JUMIN,It would be enough
JUMIN,for him to show his gratitude
JUMIN,in the near future…
JUMIN,I must get back. I should try the wine.
JUMIN,When do you plan to go to bed?
MC,"Right now. After talking with you, I feel like I’ll finally be able to sleep ^^"
JUMIN,I suppose I helped you fall asleep.
JUMIN,"Next time, if you can’t go to bed, I suggest drinking a glass of wine."
JUMIN,It helps.
JUMIN,"Oh,"
JUMIN,but you may be underage… so I must be careful in recommending such things.
MC,I’m of age.
JUMIN,I’m glad to hear that then.
MC,I plan to stay up a bit more.
JUMIN,It’s very late. Are you too nervous to go to bed?
JUMIN,I would like to call your family if I new them… It’s unfortunate that I can’t.
JUMIN,I’m sure it’ll be stressful to force yourself to go to sleep…
JUMIN,"so I suggest you try reading, writing, or drawing,"
JUMIN,and such creative things.
JUMIN,I heard night sentimentality can be a great resource.
JUMIN,Then I’ll get going.
JUMIN,Have a good night.
YOOSUNG,MC… Did you read what Jumin said?
YOOSUNG,Family tradition? ^^
YOOSUNG,gratitude for his advice? hahaha
MC,God… He really doesn’t understand how you feel T_T
YOOSUNG,That’s what I mean…
YOOSUNG,I’m a grown up~!
YOOSUNG,Why did he call my mom when I said no? T_T
YOOSUNG,I came here in secret as soon as I woke up hoping for some news…
MC,"Yoosung, I hope you’re having fun with your mom ^^"
YOOSUNG,"You’re not serious, are you?"
YOOSUNG,But
YOOSUNG,seriously
YOOSUNG,how the hell
YOOSUNG,does he think I’m having FUN!!!
YOOSUNG,"If I talk with my family, I’ll suffocate from all the lectures from them… ^^"
YOOSUNG,Do you know this?
YOOSUNG,I had to peel onions yesterday…
YOOSUNG,Do you know why…?
MC,To make Kimchi?
YOOSUNG,OMG!
YOOSUNG,How did you know?
YOOSUNG,You must be psychic T_T
YOOSUNG,T_T…
MC,To eat noodles?
YOOSUNG,But onions come in the noodles…
YOOSUNG,I wish that were the case..
YOOSUNG,My mom said that
YOOSUNG,she’ll make kimchi for my health…
YOOSUNG,ZEN!!
ZEN,Hey Yoosung.
ZEN,Having a good time with your mom again?
YOOSUNG,Do you want me to fight you?
ZEN,Ha
ZEN,Haha
ZEN,"MC, good morning ^^"
MC,"Hello, Zen~"
ZEN,Nothing happened last night I hope?
MC,Yes… unfortunately.
ZEN,What do you mean unfortunately?!
ZEN,That’s a good thing!!
YOOSUNG,Hahahaha
MC,lololol Don’t worry. I’m doing fine with Seven.
YOOSUNG,Of course lolol
ZEN,Thank god.
ZEN,But lololololololololol
ZEN,"Yoosung, you’re making Kimchi right now?"
YOOSUNG,I’m in the kitchen…
YOOSUNG,A huge red bowl… and pepper flakes… lol
YOOSUNG,T_T….
ZEN,lolololol
YOOSUNG,I asked her how we’re gonna make kimchi in this tiny room…
YOOSUNG,but my mother can make anything possible ^0^
ZEN,Help her as best as you can lololol
ZEN,Learn a thing or two at this chance lololol
MC,"Give me some of the kimchi when you’re finished, haha."
YOOSUNG,I think there will be more than enough…
YOOSUNG,"Do you want some too, Zen?"
ZEN,My fans already sent me enough kimchi… lolol
YOOSUNG,-_-
ZEN,"What else can I do? They made it themselves, I can’t just return it, can I? ^^"
ZEN,You enjoy all of it.
YOOSUNG,Pouring narcissistic fuel on torturing flame…
MC,Good luck… T_T
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,What do you mean learn…?
YOOSUNG,"Even in home economics, we don’t peel this much onions."
ZEN,lolololol
YOOSUNG,I’ve been tearing up nonstop
YOOSUNG,peeling and chopping onions all day T_T
YOOSUNG,My eyes hurt…..
ZEN,Such a cry baby lolol
YOOSUNG,I was crying because of the onions but my mom keeps telling me
YOOSUNG,it’s because of using my phone so much so she’s lecturing me as a plus!
ZEN,lololololololol I can totally imagine that lololol
YOOSUNG,Playing LOLOL would make me feel better but I can’t even do that…
YOOSUNG,I feel like
YOOSUNG,I
YOOSUNG,am gonna go crazy…… lolol
YOOSUNG,My hands are shaking and my eyes keep twitching.
ZEN,People call that withdrawal symptoms…
ZEN,That’s happening to me too since I’ve quit smoking…
ZEN,Let’s both hang in there.
YOOSUNG,……
MC,"Still Yoosung, you have a better daily routine now ^^;"
ZEN,Yeah lololol
ZEN,"Still,"
ZEN,finally you’re living like a human.
YOOSUNG,What about this is living like a human…?
MC,Rules are meant to be broken…
ZEN,"MC, that’s a dangerous thing to say lololol"
YOOSUNG,My mother’s rules… I wanna break them.
ZEN,"Dude, wake up lololololol"
YOOSUNG,I wanna game!!!!
YOOSUNG,GAME!!!
ZEN,Hmm…
ZEN,The reason why that dude called your mother…
ZEN,is to save you from game addiction.
YOOSUNG,Zen… what are you saying? lolololol
YOOSUNG,Jumin saved me y pushing me into the deep dark pit of 24/7 lecturing?
YOOSUNG,How the hell does that even make sense?!?!?!
ZEN,lololololol This is hilarious.
MC,I agree with Zen. lol
YOOSUNG,What’s wrong with the both of you T_T
ZEN,lololol
ZEN,I’m not saying that the jerk did a good thing.
ZEN,But it’s nice that he helped you play games less.
ZEN,But he was super nosy about calling your mom without even asking you first.
YOOSUNG,Yeah!! That’s my whole point!
YOOSUNG,"You know, why is Jumin never here when I am? haha"
YOOSUNG,I have a bunch of things to talk to him about;;;
ZEN,Oh~
ZEN,You’re finally picking a bone with him?
YOOSUNG,Yeah of course!
YOOSUNG,Isn’t he super arrogant
YOOSUNG,to think that he did a good thing!?
ZEN,"Yeah~… I don’t know if he’s being arrogant,"
ZEN,but you have to tell him what you think!
ZEN,He might call your father next time
ZEN,if you just let this pass.
YOOSUNG,"Oh,"
YOOSUNG,god.
YOOSUNG,Not that…
YOOSUNG,Please have mercy…
ZEN,Have you called him yet?
YOOSUNG,"I did the first day she came, but he didn’t pick up because he’s in the middle east,"
YOOSUNG,and now he won’t pick up because of his meetings or something T_T
ZEN,Of course -_-;
ZEN,Can barely hear that guy’s voice.
YOOSUNG,MC…
YOOSUNG,I know this isn’t the thing to say right now…
YOOSUNG,but I’d just like to say this.
ZEN,What??
YOOSUNG,I’m a bit jealous of Seven…
YOOSUNG,"He’s there alone with you,"
YOOSUNG,Can I go there too? haha
MC,"Hmm… Seven is very busy with work, and I have to keep the secrecy."
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,Yeah… I thought so.
YOOSUNG,Thought I’d just mention it… I feel like anywhere would be better than here…
MC,I like staying here in Seven’s arms by myself.
ZEN,WHAT
YOOSUNG,I’m sorry.
YOOSUNG,I should have gotten the hint ^^
ZEN,You’re kidding right?????
YOOSUNG,Of course she is lololol
ZEN,……………
YOOSUNG,Seriously wish I could go lolol
YOOSUNG,I wanna go i wanna go….
ZEN,Hey!!!!
ZEN,Where the hell do you think you’re going!!!
ZEN,….
ZEN,….Is that why you thought I’d say? lol
ZEN,I wish I could go too…
YOOSUNG,lolololol
ZEN,I wanna see MC!!!
ZEN,I wanna see with my own eyes that nothing’s going on between them!!
YOOSUNG,What? lol No way lololol
MC,So what id something is going on? ^^
ZEN,"MC, I know that you’re joking but please don’t say that T_T"
ZEN,What if something really does happen!
ZEN,"If you can’t think properly with seven there,"
ZEN,just go to the album and look at all my selfies.
ZEN,That will clear up your head.
MC,Trust me~
ZEN,Yeah.
ZEN,"I can’t trust Seven,"
ZEN,but I guess I can trust MC.
YOOSUNG,God…
YOOSUNG,I thought I was finally going to relieve my stress by being here
YOOSUNG,but Zen;; I think I have to leave….
ZEN,Why? To make Kimchi?
YOOSUNG,Yup.
ZEN,lolololololol
ZEN,"Yeah… well, you’re gonna be the one who eats it."
ZEN,Do your best lolololol
YOOSUNG,"When Jumin comes in later, please let him know"
YOOSUNG,how much I’m suffering… ^^
ZEN,"lolololol I doubt he’d ever listen to me, but I’ll try."
MC,Yoosung… it’ll all be over soon. Have hope!!!
YOOSUNG,I think all my hope vanished ever since my mom came here…
YOOSUNG,I’ll just do my best….
YOOSUNG,It’ll only be worse if I keep complaining ^^
MC,Save a batch for me ^^
YOOSUNG,I’d like a batch of hope….
ZEN,Fun pun lol
YOOSUNG,Haha yeah….
ZEN,Cheer up bro.
YOOSUNG,"MC,"
YOOSUNG,hope for my safe return.
ZEN,Bye.
YOOSUNG,I’ll get going T_T
ZEN,That dude has a fun life lololol
ZEN,He’s totally in his mom’s hands right now.
ZEN,I can see what his life will be like when he gets married. lololol
MC,He’s kind of my taste lolol
ZEN,I guess you like men who listen to you.
ZEN,"I… like a woman who listens to me,"
ZEN,but I like seeing them happy when I listen to them.
MC,"He pretends he hates it, but it’s nice to see him go along with it."
ZEN,Yeah lol
ZEN,He’s not being super rebellious or anything.
ZEN,I feel like he might cry when his mom  leaves lol
ZEN,"But,"
ZEN,I had something I had to ask you. Yoosung’s kimchi story totally distracted me;;
ZEN,I understand why there’s a special security system at your apartment…
ZEN,but how is the information protected?
ZEN,I’m just asking because Jumin wanted to send over bodyguards earlier.
ZEN,We have to know how well the security system will protect you.
ZEN,…Don’t you think? lol
MC,Maybe there’s an alarm and the police will come?
ZEN,Right? lol
MC,I feel like there’s a bomb here…
ZEN,lololol
ZEN,MC! That’s a harsh joke!
ZEN,"No matter how well protected the apartment needs to be,"
ZEN,I think a bomb is too much.
ZEN,"I mean lolol It’s illegal,"
ZEN,"I don’t know what it is,"
ZEN,but it’ll be pretty advance and safer than CCTV cameras.
ZEN,Haha.
ZEN,I’m pretty smart to have these questions lol
ZEN,Anyways… If Seven or Jumin knows anything… I hope they tell us.
ZEN,We have to come up with a way to protect you together.
ZEN,"MC,"
ZEN,I better go work out now.
ZEN,What are you gonna do?
MC,I have plans. A date with Seven!
ZEN,I’ll consider it a platonic date…
ZEN,I want to quit lecturing people...
MC,I’m just going to read so that I don’t bother Seven.
ZEN,Okay… Rest up.
ZEN,I’ll finish my work out fast so that you’re not bored lol
ZEN,Then I’ll
ZEN,get going.
ZEN,Laterz.
Saeran,Saeyoung.
Saeyoung,…
Saeran,Seeyoung!
Saeyoung,Huh? You called me?
Saeran,What are you reading so intently? Are you allowed to read that…?
Saeyoung,Oh… You can’t look. Mom will scold us if she finds out.
Saeran,What’s the book about?
Saeyoung,It’s about computers… I heard that you can make a lot of money if you know this. Someone at church told me.
Saeran,Make a lot of money? How would you do that…?
Saeyoung,First… don’t tell mom about this book. Okay?
Saeran,Okay. But we can’t make money. Dad makes money and gives it to mom… Mom said that we can’t touch it or have it.
Saeyoung,"That’s not true. I can make money. And then, I’m going to get us out of there."
Saeran,But what if mom catches us? I’m so scared… I don’t want you to get hurt.
Saeyoung,"…Whatever I do, just pretend that you didn’t see any of it. You don’t know anything. Okay?"
Saeran,Okay… I really don’t know anything…
Saeran,"But… I’m really hungry… Mom comes home late, right?"
Saeyoung,You didn’t eat while I went out on an errand?
Saeran,"I cried because there was a spider in the kitchen, and mommy didn’t give me food for being loud."
Saeyoung,"Here, take this."
Saeran,Wow! Bread.
Saeyoung,This is a secret too.
Saeran,Okay! But where did you get this? At church?
Saeyoung,Yeah. The girl there gave it to me.
Saeran,What do you do at church? Do they give you a lot of food?
Saeyoung,Don’t be so curious. I’ll bring better things next time. First eat the bread. You said you’re hungry.
Saeran,"Okay! Thanks, Saeyoung…!"
Saeran,I want to go on errands too… Then I’ll be able to go church and get food…
Saeran,But… I’ll probably be too scared to go. And mom will just catch me. I’m your twin but I’m smaller and weaker… I won’t be able to do anything.
Saeyoung,"Don’t think that way. If we just get out of here, we can do anything you want."
Saeran,No way… You’re always so positive.
Saeran,It must be so nice… Mom doesn’t keep you locked inside… I wish mom would hate me too and let me go. Then I can be positive like you… I might even think that we can get out of here.
Saeyoung,Saeran… I’m sorry that this is all I can do right now. I’m going to memorize everything in this book…. Then I’ll make a lot of money and we can escape this place.
Saeran,Will that day really come?
Saeyoung,It will. Trust me. She said that I’d be able to.
Saeran,She? That girl who gave you the bread?
Saeyoung,Yeah. So… just trust me until then and hang in there.
Saeyoung,I’ll make sure to save you. Don’t get sick and try your best to stay away form mom. Alright?
Saeran,Okay. I really really hope that happens…!
JUMIN,Hmm… Pity.
MC,What is?
JUMIN,Oh.
JUMIN,"Hello, MC."
JUMIN,I wanted to proceed with the desert golf course and cat wine project as soon as I came back…
JUMIN,but Assistant Kang came up with a fairly good proposal.
JUMIN,this is coffee harvest season in the middle east.
JUMIN,Assistant Kang suggested we connect the coffee the Oil Prince produces to our Roastery Association
JUMIN,It’s an offer I can’t refuse…
MC,I see how much effort Jaehee put in ^^;
JUMIN,Assistant Kang has been writing up many more proposals recently.
JUMIN,I suppose it’s because she always focuses on her work.
MC,Oh! Can we invite that association to our party.
JUMIN,Of course we can.
JUMIN,I’ll tell Assistant Kang to send them an email.
JUMIN,You really are a very responsible person to care for the party even in this situation.
707,Jumin…
707,"Oh,"
707,hello MC…
MC,"Seven, how is work going?"
707,Fine.
MC,Hey honey.
707,I don’t have time to joke around…
JUMIN,The situation’s tough I see.
JUMIN,You both are here when you are in the same house?
707,Yes.
707,"I came here because I have something to tell you, Jumin."
JUMIN,I hope everything’s fine at the apartment?
707,For now.
JUMIN,Then I’m glad.
707,I read what you said last night.
707,About revealing the address for this place…
MC,"What do you think, Seven?"
707,In my opinion…
707,"we shouldn’t reveal it right now,"
707,"but when I decide that it’s dangerous, we should reveal the address."
JUMIN,Hmm…
707,"Thanks for the suggestion, Jumin."
707,I understand you thinking that way since we can’t reach V.
MC,I think it’ll be good to follow Jumin’s idea.
JUMIN,Thanks for agreeing.
707,I don’t think that he’s wrong.
707,"But,"
707,"as much as the hacker is dangerous, it’s too early to involve everyone."
JUMIN,Well…
JUMIN,I think we should be involved all the more if he’s dangerous…
707,please just trust me…
MC,"I’ll believe in you, Seven."
707,"I’m not saying that everyone should trust me with everything,"
707,but I know best when it comes MC’s safety.
MC,"Seven, let’s go play once everything is safe~"
707,This isn’t the time to be talking about that right now.
JUMIN,"First,"
JUMIN,"if that’s what you think when you’re there,"
JUMIN,I won’t say anything.
JUMIN,Just don’t forget that I’m always ready to help out.
707,Okay.
707,Thanks Jumin. That makes me feel safe.
707,If MC gets in danger because of me…
707,I will make sure… to ask you for help.
MC,Me in danger because of you…? Don’t even say that.
JUMIN,What do you mean by that?
JUMIN,In danger because of you?
707,Don’t worry about it for now.
JUMIN,I wish you’d give a proper explanation.
707,I’ll explain everything when the time comes.
MC,I hope only Seven protects me…
707,But there may come a time when I can’t.
JUMIN,What do you mean you can’t?
JUMIN,"If you want us to set up a plan, then I think you should tell us exactly what’s going on."
707,I’ll tell you when things are more settled.
707,Not now.
JUMIN,You and V… You both are so frustrating.
707,Sorry. I’m just following what I think is safest.
JUMIN,"Anyways, so we don’t have to worry about the security system?"
707,I’ve been working on it since yesterday so everything’s back to normal…
707,and I switched up all the algorithms too.
JUMIN,So the security’s been tightened?
707,Yes…
JUMIN,Let me ask you this one thing.
JUMIN,Zen asked this earlier…
JUMIN,but how does the security system work?
JUMIN,I have to know how it works to prepare a security team just in case.
707,Oh.
707,Well… It just gets rid of the intruder.
JUMIN,Interesting.
JUMIN,Gets rid of intruders how?
JUMIN,Are you saying there’s a weapon implanted?
MC,What? No way~
JUMIN,I do feel quite ridiculous saying it.
JUMIN,We’re not in a film or anything.
707,That’s…
707,Jumin’s right.
JUMIN,What?
MC,I don’t know… Can you reveal the secret?
707,It is secret…
707,"but since it concerns your safety, I think it’s time for me to talk about it."
JUMIN,Let me hear it then.
707,The special security system….
707,is something that can get rid of the intruder and burn all the information at once.
707,It’s a bomb.
JUMIN,You’re joking.
MC,···
707,Rika requested this herself to protect the information. And V agreed.
JUMIN,I can’t believe you.
MC,"Hahaha, that’s funny Seven."
707,MC…. I’m not joking right now.
707,Let me explain.
JUMIN,Are you serious.
707,Rika and V approved this.
707,That’s how important our previous guest information was… so much so that even we couldn’t handle it…
JUMIN,The bomb won’t just get rid of the intruder and the information…
JUMIN,"It can get rid of everything inside, even innocent people in there, no?"
707,You’re right….
JUMIN,Rika made the decision to implant a device that can take out lives? Just to protect information?
707,Rika… Rika just wanted to use it as a threat.
JUMIN,That’s not something the Rika I know would do.
JUMIN,I can’t believe I didn’t hear about this.
707,Jumin…
JUMIN,You know that you and MC are at risk right now.
MC,… I trust Seven will find a way to solve all this.
JUMIN,Everything is over once the bomb goes off.
JUMIN,What does trust have anything to do with this?
707,I will never let the bomb go off.
JUMIN,How can you be so sure?
707,Since we’re more safe by being in danger..
MC,I want to leave T_T
JUMIN,Of course you’d want to now that you know there’s a bomb there.
707,"Since the hacker is after MC,"
707,it’s safer to be at a place that’s in high danger like this.
JUMIN,"If you’re talking about a defense strategy, it sound very irresponsible."
707,That was Rika’s plan.
JUMIN,My bodyguards will be useless then.
JUMIN,I can’t believe Rika chose to be such an idiot.
707,I understand how shocked you are.
707,But you know what’s important right now.
707,What’s important is that everyone knows this now
707,and that MC won’t be in danger even if something happens to me later on…
JUMIN,Let me call you right now.
707,Oh…
707,Sorry Jumin.
707,"The guy came to fix our glass, so I have to go."
707,"MC, will you quit the messenger and come with me?"
JUMIN,I can’t believe this.
JUMIN,A bomb for a security system…?
JUMIN,What the hell was Rika thinking?
MC,I think I have to go. Let me talk over this with Seven.
JUMIN,MC… Call me if you need my help.
JUMIN,It may be too late once you call…
JUMIN,But please be careful.
MC,Were you close with Rika?
JUMIN,We were.
JUMIN,I didn’t think she’d have such a huge secret…
JUMIN,I’m honestly in shock.
JUMIN,I need time to think.
JUMIN,I’ll be off.
707,Jumin keeps on calling me…
 Kim,I don’t know what you threw to break this glass… but be careful from now on. I’ve never seen anything like this before.
707,Of course. Here’s cash.
 Kim,Do you want a receipt?
707,I don’t need it. Take care.
 Kim,Thank you. Don’t throw things even when you get angry form now on. Young people these days…
MC,"He must have thought we’re a newly wed. Well, we practically are since we’re living together thanks to your brother."
707,"He’s very strange to think so, and so are you."
MC,How do you think your brother broke through the glass?
707,I don’t know. You’d probably know better since you were there.
707,I don’t want to think about it.
707,"I’m sorry, but please don’t mention my brother right now. My brain will explode if I think about that too."
707,And one more thing… can you really stay that calm? You’ve been chatting me up since yesterday… you’re really strange.
707,Aren’t you scared that there’s a bomb there?
MC,I want to live happily ever after here with you and the bomb~
707,I’m really curious which planet you came from…
MC,I’m not scared at all with you here!
707,"It’s nice to see you be positive, but you should always be careful."
707,I didn’t come here from a sense of justice. I came because you are in serious danger.
707,"It’s good that you’re not anxious, but please be more aware of the situation."
707,Aren’t you supposed to get angry at me? I’m the one who put you in danger…
707,I’m so angry at myself… why aren’t you mad at me?
MC,Being in danger is thrilling and exciting! Let’s have fun together.
707,you’re amazing to say that when your life is at risk.
707,"…If you’ve been chased by danger your whole life, you wouldn’t be able to say that."
MC,"If it weren’t for you, I would have been kidnapped then. But thanks to you, I’m fine."
707,…That’s not important. Your life was at risk as a result.
707,"I wish none of this ever happened. That bomb, and you joining the organization…!"
707,"Don’t ever download weird apps on your phone. Oh… Well, that’s none of my business."
707,I’m going to do what I can now. So you do what you can too. Just stay still and safe.
707,"I’m going to put on my headphones and work now, so don’t bother me."
MC,"Seven, why the headphones? Are you avoiding me?"
MC,Honey~ Look at this~
707,…
707,…Requesting to satellite … code is G2X0…
707,coordinates are… 16.29562… 500:1… possible satellites… Germany. France…
707,Analyzing header information… decoding hash code… altering visual information…
YOOSUNG,MC!!! Are you okay?
MC,"Yes, of course."
YOOSUNG,THERE IS A BOMB?
MC,"? Yoosung, is something happening?"
YOOSUNG,You’re with a bomb right now?????
YOOSUNG,A bomb… from the movies
YOOSUNG,that blows everything away!!!
YOOSUNG,How can this be happening!?
YOOSUNG,MC… I’m so worried!
YOOSUNG,And I’m sorry… T_T
YOOSUNG,You were there preparing for the party to help our organization…
YOOSUNG,So you were with a bomb all along;;;
YOOSUNG,I can’t believe Rika requested it;;;
MC,I never thought Rika would be someone to request a bomb….
YOOSUNG,Me neither!
YOOSUNG,I can’t believe it…
YOOSUNG,It’s so unlike her
YOOSUNG,to ask for a bomb that can hurt lives…!
MC,This is all because of Rika;;
YOOSUNG,I understand that you’d think that way…
YOOSUNG,"But the Rika I know,"
YOOSUNG,would never suggest to implant a bomb that can hurt people’s lives
YOOSUNG,no matter how important the information might be….
YOOSUNG,Why….
YOOSUNG,"I didn’t know this was going on,"
YOOSUNG,and was actually talking about her with my mom during lunch.
YOOSUNG,She told me that
YOOSUNG,Rika wouldn’t be happy from up there
YOOSUNG,"to see me miss school, skip meals,"
YOOSUNG,and spend my whole day playing games…
YOOSUNG,So…
YOOSUNG,"I’ve been looking back on how I’ve been living my life,"
YOOSUNG,and told myself that I wouldn’t embarrass her any longer
YOOSUNG,and start setting proper goals and do volunteering work again…
YOOSUNG,I was encouraging myself by thinking of her…
YOOSUNG,And now I find out that she asked for a bomb in her apartment…?
YOOSUNG,Why are we getting to know this now?
YOOSUNG,You could have been really hurt because of that.
YOOSUNG,What the hell was V thinking?!
MC,There must be a reason…?
YOOSUNG,What could that reason be!
YOOSUNG,He’s traveling right now
YOOSUNG,and no one can reach him!!
YOOSUNG,V just keeps disappointing me…
MC,V went too far with this…
YOOSUNG,Yeah!
YOOSUNG,And even if she wanted the bomb
YOOSUNG,shouldn’t V have stopped this…??
YOOSUNG,He’s been keeping this a secret for a long time now.
YOOSUNG,I’m sick of getting mad at him.
YOOSUNG,I’m glad that Seven told us the truth now at least…
YOOSUNG,but I feel like there will be more secrets that we don’t know about.
YOOSUNG,What else do you think they’re hiding?
MC,They might be hiding something more dangerous than the bomb~! OMG >.<
YOOSUNG,You don’t have to pretend to be bright to cheer me up T_T
YOOSUNG,This isn’t the time for that!
YOOSUNG,You must be really frustrated and nervous too…
YOOSUNG,I feel worse seeing you pretend to be bright for us.
MC,I don’t know about that… But Seven will let us know what we need to know.
YOOSUNG,Right?
YOOSUNG,I trust Seven…
YOOSUNG,But…
YOOSUNG,Do you think RFA is okay like this…?
YOOSUNG,I’m so worried I can’t stand it;;
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,"I’m sorry to change the subject,"
YOOSUNG,but I think my mom finished organizing the fridge.
YOOSUNG,I don’t want her to see me sad so I should start smiling.
MC,"Cheer up, Yoosung. You won’t get lucky with a sad face!"
YOOSUNG,Thank you…. It must be so hard for you to say that right now T_T
YOOSUNG,"If I get lucky, I’ll give all my luck to you."
YOOSUNG,I’ll cheer up and come back later!
MC,Have fun with your mom….
YOOSUNG,My situation was nothing compared to the bomb;;;
YOOSUNG,Be careful! I’ll be back soon!
Vanderwood,God… Why do I have to clean up after that guy…? So damn hard.
Vanderwood,"I’m never letting this go, Luciel… Just you wait.."
Vanderwood,Huh? The boss is calling…?
Vanderwood,"Hello? Yes, boss. Oh, no! I’m taking care of it right now."
Vanderwood,"But I think I will need more time. It’s not an excuse… he barely did any of the work… No, I can do it. I just need more time. Is the agency fine?"
Vanderwood,"I’m tracing Agent 707 right now but he’s under the radar. Once I see any movement, I’ll start tracking him again."
Vanderwood,"The car he took is parked at a department store, and I have access to the security cameras. And secretly put a GPS tracking device on the car."
Vanderwood,"Yes, I’ll start tracking him down as soon as I finish this clients job."
Vanderwood,Do not worry. I will take care of it as soon as possible. And I… will take responsibility of 707’s last.
YOOSUNG,MC!!! Are you okay?
MC,"Yes, of course."
YOOSUNG,THERE IS A BOMB?
MC,"? Yoosung, is something happening?"
YOOSUNG,You’re with a bomb right now?????

JUMIN,"MC, hello."
JUMIN,What is Luciel doing right now?
JUMIN,He’s not taking my calls.
MC,"Hello, Jumin. I think Seven’s busy."
JUMIN,V and Luciel… They are both the same in that you can’t ever reach them.
MC,I guess he doesn’t know you’re calling since he’s so focused on work;; That boy. I’ll tell him that you called.
JUMIN,Thank you. But I will just talk to him later.
JUMIN,Since he’ll come here at least.
JUMIN,It’s definitely shocking that the security system is a bomb.
JUMIN,"But thanks to my small efforts, I would like to point out that there’s one good thing out of this horrible situation."
MC,Are you talking about Yoosung?
JUMIN,"Yes, I am."
JUMIN,Yoosung had a major life revelation thanks to me.
JUMIN,Didn’t he say that he’d start setting goals for himself and start volunteering again?
JUMIN,Family is indeed a great gift.
JUMIN,"To add and talk about myself,"
JUMIN,my lunch with my father was very satisfactory.
MC,Did he bring his girlfriend?
JUMIN,"No, there wasn’t any women there."
JUMIN,Father wanted to spend quality time with me as well.
JUMIN,We are indeed family… we must have thought the same thing.
JUMIN,He gave me a diamond pen to congratulate me on securing the new contract with the oil prince.
JUMIN,"Personally, I do not like pens with jewels on them. You might be blinded while using them."
JUMIN,"But since it’s a gift from my family, I thought I must put it to good use."
JAEHEE,;;;
MC,You’ll have to find a good cause that suits such a magnificent pen ^^
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,Value is dependent on not only the thing itself but the use of it as well.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han…
JUMIN,?
JAEHEE,I am amazed that you managed to talk about only the good news in such a devastating situation;;
JUMIN,Is that a compliment?
JAEHEE,"You seem extremely concerned earlier so I was worried, but I suppose I won’t have to."
ZEN,The special security system…
ZEN,is a bomb….!?!?
ZEN,WTF!!
MC,Save me T_T
ZEN,MC!
JAEHEE,Oh no…
ZEN,I wish I could run over there right now!
ZEN,Why the hell is a bomb there?
JAEHEE,I really cannot understand the bomb.
MC,"Hello, Zen."
JAEHEE,Hello.
JAEHEE,I had to stop work because I was so shocked…
ZEN,Does it make sense to implant a bomb on a building with people inside!?
JAEHEE,"Usually, no."
ZEN,Yeah!!!
ZEN,No wonder Seven ran over there that fast.
ZEN,I can’t believe MC was alone in a house with a bomb!!!
ZEN,"If that system’s hacked or something, the bomb could go off!"
JAEHEE,I can’t even imagine such a horrible thing…
MC,"T_T I’m so scared, Zen…"
ZEN,MC….
ZEN,God…
ZEN,He left a girl with a bomb?!
ZEN,Hey jerk!
ZEN,You really don’t know the address?
MC,That won’t happen since Seven’s here.
ZEN,"It’s nice to trust him,"
ZEN,but the bomb itself is super dangerous!
JAEHEE,I can’t help but admire how calm MC is right now.
ZEN,"I get that you’re a nice person,"
ZEN,but you shouldn’t be shielding him just because you like him.
ZEN,It’s a fact that he’s been keeping a secret that directly involves your safety!!
JUMIN,Hmm.
JUMIN,Zen is overly excited right now.
ZEN,Don’t analyze me! Of course I’m mad!!
ZEN,MC was left alone with a BOMB!?!!
ZEN,Seven agreed to have MC stay in the apartment even when he knew there was a bomb there!
ZEN,And V knew about that!
ZEN,"Seriously, do they have a conscience?!"
MC,They were both really mean T_T
ZEN,They weren’t just mean…!!
JUMIN,"I think you are getting too excited right now, so stop."
JAEHEE,I think it’s understandable in the current situation…
MC,"Stay calm, Zen."
JUMIN,Yes. Nothing will change by you getting angry.
ZEN,-_-
JAEHEE,This is a situation that calls for anger though.
JUMIN,This is a waste of my time.
JUMIN,"It’s more effective to suppress our emotions, save our energy,"
JUMIN,and search for what we can do.
ZEN,"yeah yeah, you save all the energy you want."
ZEN,What can I expect from a guy who tells me to suppress all my emotions!
ZEN,UGH!!!!
JAEHEE,Zen…
ZEN,"Jaehee, aren’t you mad about this??"
JAEHEE,Well…
JAEHEE,"A person’s life is on the line here, so I am trying to be careful with my words."
ZEN,Oh…
ZEN,Jumin Han… learn from your assistant.
ZEN,How can you brag about a pen your dad gave you right now?!
ZEN,Are you seriously going to stay in your own little world?
JUMIN,I wasn’t bragging. I was only talking about the importance of family.
JUMIN,I wanted to connect my story with the good change that’s occurring in Yoosung’s life at the moment.
ZEN,"Yeah yeah, you’re so great, aren’t you?!"
ZEN,So you’ve thought up a plan while I was getting mad?
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,I was wondering if we could evacuate MC to another location.
JAEHEE,Yes… I thought of that as well.
JAEHEE,"Now that we know that there is a bomb, it wouldn’t make sense to keep MC there."
MC,Then what about the party?
ZEN,That’s not what’s important right now!!
ZEN,You’re safety first and then we’ll worry about the party.
JUMIN,MC has a point.
MC,I want to leave right now T_T
ZEN,Yeah! Of course.
ZEN,This won’t do.
ZEN,"Once I get in touch with Seven, I’ll have to tell him to get you out of there."
JUMIN,"First, calm down."
JUMIN,The messenger app that MC is using is connected to Rika’s apartment… so we have to think if she can leave before the party.
ZEN,"What’s important to you, the party or her life?"
JUMIN,Both.
JUMIN,"What do you think, Assistant Kang?"
JAEHEE,I think we should discuss with Seven about the move.
JAEHEE,"Since if it were possible to relocate her, I think he would have already done it."
JUMIN,You have a point.
MC,"I think so too, since Seven is very thoughtful."
ZEN,…
ZEN,I don’t really know now.
ZEN,I don’t know how thoughtful
ZEN,Seven and V are when they knew all of this before.
JAEHEE,"Zen, I think you should try to calm down first."
MC,Will Seven come with me if I move? I don’t want to go alone~!
ZEN,Of course he won’t!
ZEN,The only reason he’s with you right now is because he’s the only one who knows the address.
ZEN,"Once you move, you’ll take an army of security guards!!"
JUMIN,Hmm…
JUMIN,Or it won’t be bad further to go to one of my company’s apartments.
JAEHEE,We’ll discuss the details with Seven…
JAEHEE,Uhm…
ZEN,Of course!! I’m sure this situation is super ridiculous too!
JAEHEE,More than anything else…
JAEHEE,I cannot believe that V hid such a dangerous weapon from us.
JAEHEE,It’s hard to understand why he did not reveal such an important information.
ZEN,"We’d be able to ask him to explain if we could reach him,"
ZEN,but no one can!!
JUMIN,"I won’t stop you from getting mad, but don’t forget that it’s hardest for MC right now."
MC,Thank you for worrying. I’m able to get through thanks to all of you.
JUMIN,"Of course, you are in our organization."
JAEHEE,We will all do our best to make sure that you are safe… but it’s not so easy when so many things are concealed.
ZEN,We have to be worried right now…
JUMIN,Zen.
ZEN,What
JUMIN,Why don’t you calm yourself down and then come back.
JUMIN,I doubt you’ll be able to come up with any solutions right now.
ZEN,"…I don’t like you giving me orders,"
ZEN,"but just as you said, I’m filled with nothing but rage right now…"
JAEHEE,Zen…
JAEHEE,I’m sure you will feel better after you’ve calmed down a bit.
ZEN,"MC, I’m sorry…."
ZEN,I can’t accept the fact that one of our own put you in danger.
ZEN,I wish I could interrogate Seven right now…
ZEN,"Not to mention, I feel betrayed by V…"
ZEN,This is so hard to sink in…
ZEN,Where the hell is V… Damn.
JAEHEE,I hope to hear V’s explanation as well.
ZEN,God…
ZEN,I can’t sit still.
ZEN,I’m going to go out for a ride…
ZEN,I feel like going insane.
JAEHEE,"If you are referring to your motorbike, then I’m concerned about your safety."
ZEN,That’s what I need right now.
ZEN,"Jumin, take care of the rest."
MC,Zen… Be careful.
ZEN,"Don’t worry about me, MC…."
ZEN,Just think about your own safety right now.
ZEN,Please…
MC,Good bye.
ZEN,I’m sorry you had to see me like this.
ZEN,I’ll be back after getting some fresh air.
JAEHEE,I’m worried… He might speed because of his emotions…
JUMIN,I doubt he’s that much of an idiot.
JAEHEE,"You seem very composed, Mr. Han."
JAEHEE,"I was not really close with V, and I never spent that much time with Rika…"
JUMIN,Yes.
JAEHEE,"But as you were very close with them, I thought you would be very shocked"
JUMIN,"To be honest,"
JUMIN,I still can’t believe that Rika made such a suggestion.
JUMIN,As far I knew… she was more of a pacifist.
JUMIN,I can’t help but think that there was something I didn’t know.
MC,I can’t stop thinking that RFA is hiding something more than the bomb.
JAEHEE,Naturally I feel less tryst towards RFA as well.
JAEHEE,"No matter how important information is, a bomb is simply too much."
JUMIN,Yes…
MC,"Jumin, you seem to trust Rika. Were you two close?"
JUMIN,She was one of very few people whom I could speak the truth.
JUMIN,So this is hard for me to accept as well.
JAEHEE,MC…
JAEHEE,Are you really fine with staying in the RFA?
MC,"Yes, I want to trust Seven."
JAEHEE,I see.
JAEHEE,"I’d like to do something to help,"
JAEHEE,"but unfortunately, there is not much I can do."
MC,"Well, I started so I should stick with it till the end~!"
JUMIN,I admire your positive attitude.
JUMIN,"Assistant Kang,"
JAEHEE,Yes?
JUMIN,I think we should prepare a security team just in case of any accidents.
JUMIN,And there are some other things I’d like to talk about.
JUMIN,Why don’t we meet in the conference room in ten minutes?
JAEHEE,Of course. I’ll prepare some materials and be there.
JUMIN,I’d appreciate it if you could bring the pen my father gave me.
JUMIN,MC.
MC,Yes?
JUMIN,Please…
JUMIN,be careful.
MC,Ya?
JUMIN,Be careful.
JUMIN,I’ll try to come up with some plan.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han may seem fine on the outside… but I see that he’s quite shocked as well.
JAEHEE,Since he accidentally left the pen his father gave him on my desk;;
JAEHEE,I must
JAEHEE,first go… and prepare for the meeting.
MC,Thank you for all your efforts…
JAEHEE,We should be the one to be thankful towards you.
JAEHEE,As you still trust us even in this situation.
JAEHEE,Then I will get going.
MC,Good bye.
JAEHEE,"Yes, I will try to come back as soon as I can."
JAEHEE,Please call me if something happens…
JAEHEE,Bye.
707,"Rika… When you said security system, I thought you were thinking about thermal detectors or an alarm system, but this blue print is…"
Rika,"It’s to protect everyone’s information. We must make big sacrifices for the greater good… You know that, Luciel."
707,"But still, this is too much. A bomb of this magnitude can kill everyone inside."
707,If I dare to make a suggestion… why don’t we invite less people next time. V will like it better too if we stay as a safe charity organization.
707,You said that you want to help those who are marginalized. RFA can do fine without such a destructive bomb.
Rika,"You can say that because you don’t know them. Once they know about us… they’ll continue to attack us. I somehow managed by myself until now, but I can’t any longer."
707,I’ll look into how much power they have then…
Rika,"No, you can’t."
707,What’s wrong? Why won’t you tell me about the intruders?
Rika,"It’s to protect you, Luciel."
707,"My job is to protect everyone, but you’ll protect me..? Think about why I am in RFA and use me. Who’s going to endure the pain if something goes wrong because of this?"
Rika,Luciel… Don’t be afraid.
707,I’m not afraid! I’m just worried for the RFA.
Rika,Trust me. We need something this powerful for me to protect everyone.
707,I trust you… but still a bomb…?!
Rika,If this is implanted… then I won’t ever go to the apartment until this intruder issue is solved.
Rika,You are not implanting a weapon that will hurt someone. You are giving me a control stick.
Rika,A control stick that will let me destroy all the information myself. Will that make you feel better Luciel?
707,"…The blue print states that the security system will go off when an intruder enters. Rika, if there is an intruder, he will die."
Rika,Yes. And so… the intruder won’t be able to enter easily.
Rika,God… Luciel… Looking at you reminds me of how innocent I was.
Rika,"You think respect and love will bring justice? No, they won’t."
Rika,"Most of the time, justice… is created by fear. If you respect mankind as peaceful creatures, you will get hurt in the end."
Rika,"If you want this system to save lives, then you need to make it aggravate fear, It’s the bitter ironic truth… and how the world works."
707,…
Rika,"Trust me, Luciel. You saw all those big shot people I invited at the past party. I understand humans so well."
707,MC… What are you doing here?
MC,I came here because I wanted to talk to you in the messenger. How is work going?
707,You’re funny.
707,I came here because I wanted to talk to everyone else but no one’s here.
MC,I wanted to talk with my honey~
707,MC…
707,Sorry but I don’t feel like joking around.
707,Did you read what everyone said?
MC,I did since I have no choice but to.
MC,Yes.
707,Then you’ll know.
707,Zen seems so hurt…
707,And everyone is confused.
707,But I’m sure this is worst for you…
707,I’m so sorry…
707,"I should have apologized earlier, I’m sorry."
707,I was just a bit flustered and got defensive.
MC,If you’re sorry than be nicer to me.
707,"I don’t know what you mean nice,"
707,but I’m trying my best to secure your safety.
MC,I’m fine. I’m sure it’s harder for you since everything’s on your shoulders.
707,Why are you so nice?
707,You’re not like anyone I know.
707,"I’m so sorry to you,"
707,but I’m sorry to everyone in the RFA as well.
707,"Although it was V’s orders,"
707,I hid from everyone about a dangerous device… I can’t imagine how betrayed everyone must feel.
707,You wouldn’t really know since you joined recently
707,but I’m sure that all the members
707,are having a hard time believing the fact that Rika requested a bomb.
MC,Rika seems to have a good reputation. I can’t believe she’s the one behind all this.
707,"Sometimes, you have to take extreme measures"
707,to prepare yourself against bad attacks.
707,She only asked for it to protect the information.
707,She had no intention of hurting anyone.
MC,I don’t know very well… but I’m sure Rika didn’t have bad intentions.
707,You’re right.
707,She only asked for it to protect the information.
707,She had no intention of hurting anyone.
707,I understood how desperate she was… so I installed it with V’s permission.
707,It’s natural that everyone’s mad…
707,about leaving you with the bomb alone all this time.
707,It’s hard for me to stay sane in this situation…
707,I’m kind of amazed that you’re able to stay so calm about this.
MC,"It hasn’t really sunk in, haha."
707,Really?
707,"Well, that’s not bad…"
707,but I didn’t think you had a hard time feeling emotions like Jumin;
MC,You’re with me.
707,"Thank you for saying that, but…"
707,God…
707,"When we first talked about having you stay in the apartment,"
707,I agreed without really thinking because I wanted to have the party again. Like an idiot.
707,I should have been alert about the security system then…
707,But it never caused any problems…
707,"and as dangerous as it is, I thought I made it that perfect."
707,So I thought it’d be fine.
707,I was arrogant.
707,So when
707,"V accepted you,"
707,I thought we’d have the party without any problems just like everyone wanted.
707,Of course…
707,I put you in danger as a result…
MC,This isn’t your fault. No one knew this was going to happen.
707,"Thank you for saying so, but I don’t think that way."
707,I’m supposed to predict everything that might happen.
707,Since I’m in charge of security…
MC,"I’m actually glad that we can be together thanks to that, haha."
707,Why are you so bright?
707,"Seeing you so positive, I feel like you’re living in a different world."
707,I…
707,I am so angry at myself for not being perfect…
707,"but right now, it’s important to make sure that everyone is safe,"
707,so I’m going to stop blaming myself and do what I can.
707,I think that is the best apology
707,"I can give for the members,"
707,and especially for you…
707,"Concerning the bomb, I will disarm it after discussing it with V,"
707,or if you decide to stay in the organization after the party… I’ll try to convince V about relocating you.
707,And I’m going to stop being arrogant and think that my system is perfect.
707,Since the hacker we’re facing might be just as good as I am.
MC,"Seven, are you really okay… after all that’s happened? You don’t have anything you want to say to me?"
707,"Even if I do, it’s pointless…"
MC,"Seven, you’re the best hacker in the world. Aren’t you supposed to be good at everything."
707,Perhaps I might not be so good of a hacker.
707,You don’t know anything about me.
707,So it’s not good to trust that I’ll do everything well.
707,Anyways…
707,"The security system is stable for now,"
707,so I’m going to start collecting information for me to invade the hacker’s headquarters.
707,I’ve told you before… but I plan to go there myself.
707,I’m not sure if I can reveal all the information and work by myself when V’s not here…
707,but there doesn’t seem to be any other choice.
MC,"Oh! Finally, we get to go for a drive to the hacker’s headquarters, haha."
707,A drive? ;;
707,"You don’t realize I’m not talking about a fun trip, right…?"
MC,Will you take me there?
707,I don’t know.
707,I’ll have to see how much the hacker will trace you
707,and decide whether it’ll be safer for you to be with me or somewhere else…
707,The RFA members
707,might think that I’m on the same team with V
707,since I’m in charge of classified information…
707,but…
707,honestly…
707,I have something personal to ask him too…
MC,I hope you get in touch with him soon.
707,Thank you.
MC,…About the hacker?
707,"It’s personal,"
707,so I won’t talk about it here.
707,MC…
707,I’m so sorry that things turned out like this.
707,And I’d like to tell everyone else
707,that I’m very sorry too…
MC,"I’m really fine, Seven."
707,Let’s be more careful from now on.
MC,Aight. I’ll accept your apology so relax and chill brah~
707,I suppose
707,you might not be able to ever understand me.
707,"When I was first in charge of security at RFA,"
707,"everyone was so welcoming and trusting,"
707,so I wanted to do my best at what I can…
707,"but now that things are like this,"
707,"I can’t help but hate myself so much,"
707,more than I ever did…
707,So you saying that everything is okay doesn’t help me at all…
MC,Can’t you stop saying sorry and do something fun?
707,I know that this is frustrating for you.
707,But I’m not here to entertain you.
MC,"You did nothing wrong, Seven. You just kept the secret as V told you and did your best…"
707,I don’t want to escape the blame
707,but thank you for understanding it that way…
707,All I wanted to do was make sure that everyone’s safe.
707,I don’t know why things are going so wrong…
707,"If everyone is disappointed in me because of this,"
707,i’ll just have to accept it…
MC,I’ll still be here even if everyone’s disappointed. lol I got your back.
707,…
MC,I’m sure RFA isn’t disappointed with you. Everyone is just worried.
707,I hope that’s the case…
707,I should go offline and work.
707,Call me if you need anything.
MC,Ya.
MC,"Okay, go ahead ^^"
707,Don’t follow me and skip your meals.
707,Bye.
YOOSUNG,MC….
YOOSUNG,Did you read what Seven said?
YOOSUNG,I didn’t realize he’d feel so bad about this..
MC,I don’t think this situation is Seven’s fault.
YOOSUNG,Yeah!!
YOOSUNG,It’s not as if Seven hid this on purpose.
MC,"Hello, Yoosung!"
YOOSUNG,"MC, I’m glad nothing’s happened."
YOOSUNG,I feel so bad to see Seven say sorry so much T_T
YOOSUNG,Oh
MC,"Zen, do you feel better?"
ZEN,MC!
ZEN,"Oh no, I guess I worried you."
MC,"Hello, Zen."
YOOSUNG,"Hey, Zen."
ZEN,Hi
YOOSUNG,Do you feel better now?
ZEN,Yeah… Riding calmed me down so I came back early.
YOOSUNG,Wow! The view’s awesome.
YOOSUNG,Where did you go?
ZEN,Yeah… I took it to celebrate.
ZEN,You know…
ZEN,I tried to quit smoking just before.
ZEN,"Now, I might as well quit all my bad habits…"
YOOSUNG,That’s good.
YOOSUNG,Jaehee was worried about you.
MC,I think Seven has a bad habit of not dating girls…
ZEN,"Don’t you have that habit too, Yoosung?"
YOOSUNG,Zen! I guess you feel fine now lol
ZEN,Yup.
YOOSUNG,What do you think about Seven’s apology?
ZEN,Well…
ZEN,I can understand him…
MC,That’s a good idea. Did you read what Seven said?
ZEN,Yeah.
ZEN,I do feel sorry
ZEN,and can sort of forgive him leaving you there…
ZEN,But if I were Seven…
ZEN,I would never have left her alone with a bomb.
YOOSUNG,Me too.
MC,Seven didn’t put me in danger on purpose… So I’d like to be understanding.
YOOSUNG,MC….
ZEN,What is that emoji?;;;
ZEN,It doesn’t suit the situation!
YOOSUNG,It’s just that I’m blushing seeing how nice MC’s to Seven!
ZEN,-_-
MC,"I guess I am in a bit of an unrealistic situation right now, haha."
ZEN,Yeah…
ZEN,Seeing you add ‘haha’ at the end is unrealistic too.
YOOSUNG,Seeing him feel so sorry
YOOSUNG,makes me feel bad…
YOOSUNG,"Even if we have to overlook what happened with Rika,"
YOOSUNG,I’m sure it’s hardest for Seven and MC right now…
YOOSUNG,I feel like we got too angry;;
ZEN,···
MC,"If Seven is hiding something, I’d like to know."
ZEN,I’d like to know too.
YOOSUNG,I think we all would like to know…
MC,I wish there weren’t any secrets from the first place…
ZEN,You said that right.
ZEN,So they should have revealed something so important from the beginning…
ZEN,I’m getting mad again.
YOOSUNG,I can’t deny that no matter how much I think about it…
ZEN,"I don’t want to attack Seven,"
ZEN,but this concerns a person’s life.
YOOSUNG,It was bad that
ZEN,I can’t just let this go.
YOOSUNG,MC didn’t know anything about the bomb when she’s the one who stayed there.
YOOSUNG,"Of course, I don’t think he could have told her directly “Be careful of the bomb~”"
YOOSUNG,but he could have at least told her to be careful in some roundabout way.
ZEN,Yeah… Exactly!
YOOSUNG,"MC decided to help RFA with the kindest intentions,"
YOOSUNG,but she actually walked into a placed rigged with a bomb;;;
YOOSUNG,I would have gotten so mad…
YOOSUNG,Why aren’t you getting angry?
MC,"I feel how sincere Seven is in trying to help me, so I want to trust him rather than get angry"
ZEN,MC… You are such a nice person.
ZEN,You manage to stay the same even in this situation…
ZEN,Seven better solve this soon…
YOOSUNG,Yeah.
YOOSUNG,"Since she’s trusting us, we have to make sure she’s safe!"
ZEN,Of course.
MC,I’m actually thinking of leaving the organization.
YOOSUNG,Really!?!?!?!
ZEN,I understand…
ZEN,I would have felt so betrayed and left already.
YOOSUNG,I wouldn’t have gone that far… but I wouldn’t have stayed still either.
ZEN,"First,"
ZEN,since seven
ZEN,"seems to be planning to confront the hackers,"
ZEN,"and relocating MC,"
ZEN,he seems to be heading towards the right direction.
YOOSUNG,"As always, I trust Seven."
YOOSUNG,"Regardless of what he did in the past,"
YOOSUNG,now he’s basically putting his life on the line to protect MC… so I feel his sincerity.
ZEN,"It’s fine since we know that Seven is doing his job at least,"
ZEN,isn’t V the problem now? ;;
YOOSUNG,Finally I feel like everyone’s noticing V as a problem;;
YOOSUNG,We can’t even reach him!!
YOOSUNG,Think of the weight of the secret Seven’s been keeping.
YOOSUNG,Don’t you feel mad that V just left Seven to carry that secret around by himself?
MC,I honestly can’t tell what V does.
ZEN,Well….
ZEN,V’s doing nothing right now.
YOOSUNG,Yeah!!
YOOSUNG,We can’t even reach him right now when all of this is happening;;;
YOOSUNG,"Ever since Rika left, he practically hasn’t done anything for RFA."
YOOSUNG,We can’t help but be suspicious of him!
MC,Seven doesn’t seem to be complaining against V… Why do you think that is?
ZEN,Seven’s always trusted and followed V;;
ZEN,He doesn’t seem to have any complaints but he does seem to have a couple of questions.
ZEN,I guess we’ll have to wait;;
YOOSUNG,This is so frustrating I can’t stand it.
YOOSUNG,V seems so
YOOSUNG,irresponsible.
ZEN,Hmm;;
ZEN,Let’s talk about V later…
ZEN,It’s not good to judge before hearing what he has to say.
YOOSUNG,I can’t trust V already;;; but well…
ZEN,"For now, let’s give more support to what Seven’s doing."
ZEN,He’s the only one
ZEN,"who knows about computer hacking,"
ZEN,so we don’t have any choice but to rely on him…
YOOSUNG,Yeah.
YOOSUNG,He seemed to have fun doing this and that on his computer
YOOSUNG,"so I thought security was naturally Seven’s responsibility,"
YOOSUNG,but can you imagine how hard it would be if someone’s life is on the line?
ZEN,Yeah…
MC,"Yoosung, you’re all grown up now."
YOOSUNG,Do I seem so?
ZEN,Yup.
ZEN,is this because of your mom?
MC,I’m sure that Seven is feeling a lot of pressure even if he pretends not to be.
ZEN,Of course.
ZEN,"I should stop getting mad now,"
ZEN,and try to think of a way to help him.
YOOSUNG,Me too!
ZEN,Wouldn’t it be better for you to stay out of it and just help your mother?
YOOSUNG,"To be honest,"
YOOSUNG,my mom is
YOOSUNG,going back home soon
YOOSUNG,"so I wanted to spend as much time as I could with her,"
YOOSUNG,but I couldn’t leave the chatroom because I’m so worried.
ZEN,When is your mom leaving?
YOOSUNG,Soon.
YOOSUNG,She looks as if she’s cleared her mission after making kimchi;;
MC,It must have been tough for your mom…
YOOSUNG,"Yeah, doing it myself"
YOOSUNG,made me realize how hard it must have been for her doing it by herself all this time.
YOOSUNG,"Next time she makes kimchi, I going to help her."
ZEN,Wow~ Yoosung! You’re a grown up now! lol
ZEN,You’re better than me lolol
MC,You’re free! Congrats!
ZEN,Major congratulations!
YOOSUNG,Yeah…
YOOSUNG,But I honestly don’t feel so happy about it.
YOOSUNG,I feel like I got used to having her around…
YOOSUNG,Oh… haha
YOOSUNG,"Anyways, I’ve said all I wanted to say,"
YOOSUNG,so I should go help my mom pack.
YOOSUNG,She seems to have lost some weight since she came here.
ZEN,You gave her trouble so make sure to be nice lol
YOOSUNG,Yeah… I should live my life properly now.
ZEN,I hate to see Jumin Han all smug
ZEN,seeing how your attitude’s changed…
ZEN,But it’s good that you’re heading towards a better path.
YOOSUNG,"Haha, thanks."
YOOSUNG,I’ll see my mom off and come back later.
MC,Okay~ Take good care of her~
YOOSUNG,Don’t worry!
ZEN,"Yeah, go ahead."
MC,Bye lol Be a good son.
YOOSUNG,Alright lolol
YOOSUNG,Then I’ll get going.
ZEN,See you later.
ZEN,That boy has changed. lol
MC,It’s nice to see him like that.
ZEN,"Yeah, haha."
ZEN,I’m a bit jealous too…
ZEN,I guess Yoosung’s such a well-rounded kid because he grew up with good parents.
MC,It’s all thanks to Jumin lol
ZEN,Oh… That guy -_-
ZEN,I want to hate him but since everything went well…
ZEN,I can’t.
ZEN,"Anyways,"
ZEN,I did get a bit too
ZEN,"excited there because of Seven,"
ZEN,but it’s not that I wanted to blame someone.
ZEN,I was just too shocked overall
ZEN,so I hope he cheers up and works hard till the end…
ZEN,I’m sure this is hardest for you… but will you please let Seven know how I feel?
MC,Please pray that things will go well for us…
ZEN,Huh?
ZEN,I can’t let another man
ZEN,have such a nice lady like you! -_-
ZEN,That’s a no no.
ZEN,"Anyways, tell Seven I can help with anything that requires strength."
MC,"Alright, I will ^^"
ZEN,"I don’t know anything about hacking,"
ZEN,but I can help with anything that requires physical work…
ZEN,Seven…
ZEN,He’s like V in that he’ll take all the burden alone for dangerous things.
ZEN,He shouldn’t though.
ZEN,RFA…
ZEN,is an organization that’s run by everyone… Everyone helps each other out…
ZEN,I wish he’d think that…
MC,I think he’ll open his heart someday ^^
ZEN,Yeah…
MC,I wish he’d open up his love for me~
ZEN,Well;;
ZEN,I respect your taste…
ZEN,"That guy… He’s always bright and funny, but I feel a wall."
ZEN,O
ZEN,oh.
ZEN,I didn’t eat dinner. I’m starving.
ZEN,I should go eat something.
ZEN,Don’t skip meals and safety first! Alright?
MC,"Okay, go eat a meal fit for a king!"
ZEN,I don’t know if that’ll be possible since I’m preparing it. lolol
ZEN,But I’ll just consider it that way ^^
MC,"Bye, Zen ^^"
ZEN,"When something happens, or you feel lonely,"
ZEN,dial h-e-a-r-t-z-e-n. Okay? lolol
ZEN,I’ll get going!
707,"…alpha, alpha…."
707,Found it. Coordinates 125-659… Mark Red.
707,Blue is 160-659. South…. Approximately 3 meters…
707,This means… the lan passes through here… and the device’s parameter is around 160 degrees…
707,The coordinates of the blind spot is…
MC,Seven~ Are you really okay not eating anything?
707,Oh… This is a song I like.
707,"Hmm, hmm~"
MC,"Honey, look at me~~"
707,This is… margin of error plus minus 0.253
707,I have to get the angle exactly right.
707,Hmm hmm hmm~
707,…towards the north door… target… coordinate 263-572
707,current time… recorded. Mark…
707,7 o’clock… thermal detector… parameter calculation…
707,…Blue… 7 in total…
707,Red…. Coordinate… 172-384… Mark.
MC,Seven~ Come here! I found a treasure~
707,…?
707,Oh…!
MC,Huh? what is this…? Do I put it in the computer…?
707,…
707,…!
707,What are you doing right now?
707,God… I don’t know if you’re just lighthearted or dumb.
707,Please listen carefully to what I have to say.
707,Do you know the saying curiosity kills the cat?
707,"You don’t have to be polite to me. You can ignore me, avoid me, even get mad at me."
707,But don’t ever get curious about what I do or the things I’ve brought.
707,"People who get curious without knowing anything, just thinking it’ll be alright… really make me tired."
707,"They don’t know how dangerous I am and how many problems I have… They just look at me and think I won’t be much, and approach me."
707,They try to open up around me without much thought.
707,Just like you.
707,But they don’t even have the ability to handle the things inside…
MC,Let’s just be friends. What’s so complicated?
707,I’ve lived a complicated life ever since I was born. A life you will never understand.
707,So don’t get curious of me.
MC,I just want to get close to you… Is that wrong?
707,That’s strange. I don’t want to get close to you at all. But why do you think so?
707,I’ve already told you. We can’t be family or friends.
707,"I don’t care whatever happens as long as you are safe, normal, and alive."
707,"You must know this already. No matter how much you try to get to know me, it’s useless."
707,The ending is already set for us.
707,"So… please, until the situation is stabilized, don’t give me any attention, and don’t forgive me for putting you in danger."
MC,You’re not even giving me a chance to become close to you…? I feel hurt…
707,That chance…
707,Don’t waste something like that on a guy like me.
707,I’ll take it that you understand what I mean now.
MC,Can’t you spend some time with me after work?
707,Did you even listen to what I just said?
707,"If you really care for me and want to help, don’t pay me any attention and just stay far away from me."
707,That is helping me… seriously.
JAEHEE,"MC, hello."
JAEHEE,How are things?
MC,Seven is working hard as usual.
JAEHEE,I see. It must be taking some time.
JAEHEE,I trust that everything will go well since you are there beside him.
JAEHEE,Also…
JAEHEE,I as well felt bad after reading what Seven said…
MC,Seven’s not playing with me T_T He doesn’t want me to pay him any attention.
JAEHEE,"Oh no… He didn’t have to say that, but I suppose he is very much on edge at the moment."
JAEHEE,I hope your feelings weren’t too hurt.
JAEHEE,"If you feel lonely, it won’t be bad to talk with the other members."
JAEHEE,"For now I’m here… Although I’m not very good at talking about personal matters,"
JAEHEE,I will try.
JAEHEE,Please be more understanding of Seven.
JAEHEE,It is true that everyone in RFA naturally forgot that Seven is doing the most work for the organization…
JAEHEE,I hope the special security system is taken care of as soon as possible for the two of you.
JAEHEE,And…
JAEHEE,"I don’t know if I should dare to make a suggestion,"
JAEHEE,"but in order to prevent such things from happening in the future, I hope RFA decides to be reveal all relevant information from the future."
JAEHEE,That way similar confusions will not occur.
MC,Do you think so?
JAEHEE,"Yes, I do."
MC,You’re absolutely right!!
JAEHEE,"Even if something dangerous happens, everyone will be able to help solving the situation."
JAEHEE,If we get back in tough with V I would very much like to discuss it with him.
JAEHEE,If we do…
MC,"Jaehee, don’t despair! He’ll be back in touch! Soon!"
JAEHEE,I’m not in despair… but I am very curious.
JAEHEE,Will we ever reach V before the party? ^^;;
MC,Do you think he’ll come back before the party…?
JAEHEE,I trust he will.
JAEHEE,But I can’t help but be a little bit doubtful.
JAEHEE,Do you know why I’m staying late at the office today?
JAEHEE,It is because I’m waiting for V’s phone call.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han said that it’s possible V might call the office in the middle of the night since there might be time difference where V is
JAEHEE,I’m an employee who can do many things…
JAEHEE,"but today, I am just sitting here waiting for the phone to ring."
JAEHEE,"Obviously, someone else can do it…"
JAEHEE,but he said I’m the only one trustworthy…
JAEHEE,"I don’t know whether that’s a compliment or a curse, but all the same, I have no choice."
MC,"It means that he trusts you, so be positive ^^; of course I’m sure it’s tough…"
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,When do you think the phone will ring? ^^
MC,"Will there ever come a day when our Jaehee can fangirl all she wants, whenever she wants!?"
JAEHEE,I do respect and support the actor I revere but…
JAEHEE,…….Life is hard.
JAEHEE,"Since I’m waiting for the phone to ring, I can fangirl some other time…"
JAEHEE,This suddenly occurred to me…
JAEHEE,"but if I report to the Assistant Human Rights Committee that I’m working late waiting for a phone call,"
JAEHEE,they might take some measures to help out.
JAEHEE,"Of course, I would never sue Mr. Han… but it’s a very nice organization."
MC,You don’t think the phone’s plugged out?
JAEHEE,….
JAEHEE,Exactly.
MC,Should we invite them to the party?
JAEHEE,I think that’s a good idea.
JAEHEE,I will send them your contact.
JAEHEE,I hope they share a serious conversation with Mr. Han ^^
JAEHEE,But…
JAEHEE,Perhaps the phone might be broken.
JAEHEE,I must go and see…
JAEHEE,Haha…
JAEHEE,I hope everything goes well for Luciel
JAEHEE,and I’ll get going.
MC,Good bye.
JAEHEE,I only hope that I won’t have to stay the night.
MC,Hang in there ^^;; Accio phone call!
JAEHEE,Thank you….^^
JAEHEE,Have a good night..
JAEHEE,Bye.
YOOSUNG,MC T_T
YOOSUNG,I feel so bad for Jaehee;
YOOSUNG,It’s so obvious that V’s not gonna call;;;
YOOSUNG,I don’t know why Jumin bothers to make Jaehee suffer!
YOOSUNG,He would have called a long time ago if he was going to.
MC,I know… Did your mother go back home?
YOOSUNG,Yes! She just texted me saying that she got on the train.
YOOSUNG,She kept on telling me not to skip meals…
YOOSUNG,And she was the one who lost weight T_T
YOOSUNG,"You know,"
YOOSUNG,I saw my mom off and came back home alone…
YOOSUNG,"And once I got back,"
YOOSUNG,All the towels were clean and my bathroom was spotless…
YOOSUNG,"my fridge was filled with fruit, kimchi, milk…"
YOOSUNG,and all my clothes were folded in the closet.
YOOSUNG,"I feel like my mom should be here sweeping the floor and giving me another lecture,"
YOOSUNG,but she just left…
YOOSUNG,I feel so empty…
MC,I guess you already miss your mom…
YOOSUNG,It wasn’t all bad having her around.
YOOSUNG,To be honest…
YOOSUNG,"my mom seemed like she had something to say on the way tot he station,"
YOOSUNG,"so I asked her what,"
YOOSUNG,and she just told me to call often.
YOOSUNG,"She always says whatever she wants to say,"
YOOSUNG,but she barely managed to say that.
YOOSUNG,I felt so bad and sorry…
YOOSUNG,I…
YOOSUNG,didn’t really know but apparently she was really sick some time ago.
YOOSUNG,"She’s fine now,"
YOOSUNG,but she didn’t tell me because she didn’t want me to worry.
MC,Stop gaming all the time and call her time to time.
YOOSUNG,I plan to!
YOOSUNG,That’s nothing.
YOOSUNG,I don’t know why I never called T_T
MC,Your mom must think about you alot.
YOOSUNG,I know.
YOOSUNG,I almost cried when I heard that.
YOOSUNG,My mom thought I was just busy with school until now
YOOSUNG,so she didn’t call me
YOOSUNG,because she didn’t want to bother me.
YOOSUNG,"But all this time,"
YOOSUNG,I never thought about my family because I was busy gaming…
YOOSUNG,I didn’t even know she was sick…
YOOSUNG,I feel so sorry T_T
MC,You can be a better son from now on~
YOOSUNG,Yup!
YOOSUNG,I’m going to call my mom a lot from now onw.
YOOSUNG,I should be the one to care for her…!
MC,"Yoosung, you’ve grown up. lol"
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,MOOOOM T_T
YOOSUNG,Oh right…
YOOSUNG,"I’m sure everyone’s busy right now,"
YOOSUNG,I feel bad going on about me and my life.
YOOSUNG,Oh.
YOOSUNG,And
YOOSUNG,"on my way back,"
YOOSUNG,I thought of what I could do for the RFA too.
YOOSUNG,I don’t know if we’ll be able to have the party with all that’s going on…
YOOSUNG,"but everything might go well and we might be able to,"
YOOSUNG,so I wanted to do something to help.
YOOSUNG,"It’s a bit embarrassing since it’s game related,"
YOOSUNG,but I want to suggest inviting the Indie Game Association to the party.
YOOSUNG,"Last night I did some research and found that they provide educational programs for making games,"
YOOSUNG,and hold a lot of networking events so that they can all share necessary technology.
MC,"Oh, that’s nice~ Let’s invite them."
YOOSUNG,Okay! Then I’ll tell them to shoot you an email.
YOOSUNG,I was actually pretty interested in that organization!
YOOSUNG,"Maybe I might be able to make good games, haha."
MC,Game related again…? I’ll pass.
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,I’m sorry… I’ll look for someone else then!
YOOSUNG,"Let’s catch that hacker,"
YOOSUNG,"get rid of that bomb,"
YOOSUNG,and make sure we have the party!
MC,"Haha, okay. Yoosung, you’re so cute."
YOOSUNG,"Once you meet me, you might actually find me manly +_+"
YOOSUNG,You might be surprised! lolol
MC,Yup! Let’s do that. Let’s trust Seven.
YOOSUNG,I’ll be supporting him!
YOOSUNG,Good luck Seven!
YOOSUNG,I’ll do my best to help!
YOOSUNG,"Then to start off my new life as a grown up,"
YOOSUNG,I’ll try to go to bed early!
YOOSUNG,Cheer up everyone!!
YOOSUNG,"And stay safe, MC!"
MC,"Yup, don’t cry because your mom’s not with you anymore and good night."
YOOSUNG,What? I won’t cry! Haha
YOOSUNG,"I’m not a mama’s boy, haha."
YOOSUNG,"See you tomorrow, MC!! Good night!!"
MC,"Thank you. Bye, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,Bye!
YOOSUNG,I hope things get better tomorrow.
YOOSUNG,Please tell Seven to cheer up!
YOOSUNG,Then I’ll get going!
Jaehee,The third spam call tonight. The phone’s working fine then.
Jaehee,Please ring… ring… V… Please let the phone ring.
Jaehee,God… Praying won’t work.
Jaehee,Where in the world is he? I can’t believe there are places without any service in this day and age.
Jaehee,Perhaps we should be working on providing phone service rather than desert golf courses….
Jumin,Assistant Kang.
Jaehee,"Mr. Han, hello. Please save me."
Jumin,What?
Jaehee,…Never mind. It just slipped out.
Jumin,V hasn’t called yet?
Jaehee,No… I don’t think he will tonight…
Jumin,I see. Then hang in there.
Jaehee,Mr. Han! Wait.
Jumin,?
Jaehee,Do you remember that sales department intern who seemed to fall in love with you at first sight? I think she will do a better job at this than me.
Jumin,No. I can’t trust anyone else with work related to RFA. No one.
Jaehee,Of course…
Elizabeth,Meow~
Jumin,"Yes, Elizabeth the 3rd. After the last time you went, some of the employees at the sales department were transferred. You’re fast, aren’t you?"
Jumin,"So I hired a new sales intern… but I am not interested in her, so don’t worry."
Jaehee,…
Elizabeth,Meow~
Jumin,But if you continue to cry so cutely like that… I’ll have to tell you this.
Jumin,Your beautiful white fur glistening in the moonlight is brighter than the milky way.
Jaehee,Achew! …I’m sorry.
Jumin,The most beautiful creature on Earth. Elizabeth the 3rd. You and I are both a selfish couple this entire world.
Jaehee,"Mr. Han, aren’t you going home? I thought you were going to leave."
Jumin,"Oh, I forgot something. I left my meeting notes in the office."
Jaehee,You could have asked me to fax them to you…
Jumin,"Elizabeth the 3rd wanted to see the office, so I brought her along. I’ll be at the office for a while so call me if anything happens."
Jaehee,"Yes, of course."
Jaehee,…He left.
Jaehee,Where’s the tape? I’m going to get rid of all the fur stuck to the ground.
Jaehee,Ph-phone!
Jaehee,Dear lord… please let it be V’s voice coming through and not some spam message…!
Jaehee,"Yes, C&R Director Jumin Han’s office."
Jaehee,…V!?
Jaehee,"Oh, lord, thank you… Oh, never mind. I was waiting for your call."
Jaehee,"No, Mr. Han is in his office. You called just in time."
Jaehee,I’ll connect you to him. Please hold.
V,MC.
V,You’re here!
MC,You’re too late…
V,I should have come earlier… I apologize.
MC,V! What’s going on!? Why are you coming so late?
V,I’m so sorry. I really don’t know what to say…
V,I don’t know how to apologize for putting you in such danger.
V,"I have something to tell everyone,"
V,"but I don’t have good service here,"
V,so I might lose service any time…
V,I must hurry.
707,e
707,V
MC,Seven! V’s finally here.
V,Luciel.
V,I’m glad you’re here!
V,I wanted to talk to you.
707,Why didn’t you answer any of my calls?
V,I’m sorry I was out of reach…
V,"I had bad service so I couldn’t read all of the messages, but I spoke to Jumin."
707,Where the hell are you?
V,I’ve been in the mountains trying to take photographs.
707,When your eyes are like that??
V,Let’s talk about that later.
MC,Eyes?
V,Don’t mind it.
V,It’s nothing.
V,"Luciel,"
V,I heard from Jumin that the special security system was hacked.
707,Jumin?
MC,Did you hear about the special security system.
V,That’s actually why I came.
V,I never imagined in my wildest dreams that the system would be hacked…
V,You must have been so surprised.
V,"Luciel, I’m so glad you were able to make it to the apartment."
707,Why did you call Jumin first?
707,What about me?
V,I did try to call you.
V,"You remember the phone you gave me before I left, the one with the bug detector?"
707,Yeah…
V,The red light kept turning on when I tried to call you.
707,What?
707,For real?
V,Yeah.
MC,Did you give him a broken phone?
707,We used that phone less than a week ago.
V,Yes… The red light kept turning on from a couple days ago.
707,I see…
MC,So the phone was bugged?
707,…We can’t rule out that possibility?
V,I came here because I couldn’t talk to you on the phone.
707,"I have a bunch of questions I want to ask you,"
707,but there’s one I need to ask so I’ll ask that.
V,"Yes, I heard that the special security system was recovered… That’s what Jumin told me."
707,Yeah. I changed all the algorithm.
707,"I have the materials in hand, so I’ll send them to you later."
V,I see.
V,Alright.
707,I think we should evacuate MC. What do you think?
V,"We only have three days left until the party,"
V,so I think we should have her move after the party.
V,Please stay there with her and protect her until then.
MC,…What do you think Seven?
707,"Since there are people who are after us right now, I think it’s actually safer to just stay still."
707,"Since the special security system’s been recovered, there’s no safer place…"
V,You’re right.
MC,Hmm… I want to move to somewhere else with Seven right now.
V,"Don’t you think it’s more dangerous to move before the party, Luciel?"
707,That’s true…
707,The hacker’s been consistently taking action ever since MC came along…
707,so the hacker definitely has MC tracked down.
707,"So… ironically, it’s safest to stay under the special security system."
V,I thought so too.
V,"Moreover, I’ll be there from the party, so if something happens, we’ll be able to discuss it right away."
V,"Oh, right."
V,Luciel…
V,I have a personal favor to ask
707,What?
V,You know that all the information stored in that apartment is classified.
707,"Yeah, that’s why I put the bomb."
V,Yes.
V,I’m just saying this caution…
V,"It’s a bit embarrassing,"
V,"but the drawer will hold some personal letters, so please don’t touch them."
MC,OMG~ Alright lolol
V,Thanks for being understanding.
707,Wait.
707,You just…
707,You just thought that I’d rummage through RFA’s secret documents without your permission?
MC,Are you doubting Seven?
V,No.
V,I’m not.
707,Then what else?
707,You did think that I’d look at RFA’s secret documents without your permission.
V,No… I was just saying it out of caution.
V,It’s because I don’t want to rehash
V,things that are related to Rika.
V,It will only hurt me.
V,You understand how I feel… right?
707,What in the world are you talking about…?
V,Luciel…
V,I understand that you’re on edge because I’ve been mia for a while…
V,I apologize if it sounded as if I can’t trust you.
V,That’s not what I wanted to say….
V,I just didn’t want anyone to read the letters.
707,That’s what I don’t get.
707,Why did you think that I’d rummage through this apartment?
707,Why are you suspecting me?
V,I wasn’t. I was just saying it so that you could be aware of it.
707,You feel really weird right now.
707,"I don’t want to doubt you,"
707,but you’re doubting me first… that’s what’s strange.
V,I said I’m not doubting you.
707,V….
707,Are those letters that important right now?
707,There’s something more important.
V,"Yeah, you’re right."
V,You’re completely right.
MC,"V, I think you made a mistake talking about the letters."
707,"I don’t know if he made a mistake, or if his doubts just slipped out…"
707,"But,"
707,I really don’t get it because I know that you’d never make a mistake like that.
V,I was just flustered
V,since no one ever entered Rika’s apartment before this…
V,I make mistakes too…
707,"V, listen to me."
707,It’s not just letters that’s here.
707,There are people.
707,I’m here
707,and so is MC.
707,"Now that you’re finally in touch,"
V,Luciel…
707,the thing we should feel worst about and most worried about
707,is MC’s safety. She walked in to a place with a bomb with good intentions to help us.
707,Shouldn’t we worry most about her safety?
V,I understand what you mean.
707,"I’ve been waiting to talk to you all this time,"
707,and finally I’m talking to you.
707,But you just…
707,came here because you got nervous
707,that I’d stop the security system and read the secret documents?
V,That’s a misunderstanding. I made a mistake.
V,That’s not it.
MC,V… You’re being suspicious. Are you nervous that Seven is here?
707,Yeah.
707,"V, are you hiding something? What are you so nervous about?"
V,Listen to me Luciel…
V,RFA’s safety is my top priority. You would know if you think about everything we’ve gone through.
707,I did a couple days ago
707,but now I don’t.
V,I guess I should head back as soon as possible.
V,I know you’re mad at me.
V,But let’s not get too excited right now.
V,Whatever you’re misunderstanding… I’ll go and take care of everything.
707,Take care…?
707,"Before I meet you,"
707,there’s something I have to ask you.
707,Can I?
V,"Luciel,"
V,I think we should talk face to face after I get back.
707,"In that ‘everything’ you just mentioned,"
707,is Saeran included there?
V,What?
707,Answer my question.
V,Why are you suddenly bringing up that name?
707,Don’t pretend like you don’t know.
V,Luciel.
V,"I don’t know what you’re thinking,"
V,but you must have heard something wrong.
707,Do you know where Saeran is and what he’s doing right now?
V,"That’s,"
V,we decided not to talk about that.
V,Don’t be like this here.
V,You know that everyone can read this.
V,Let’s talk by ourselves when I get back.
707,"No, I don’t want to."
707,Don’t run away and say it here.
707,So that I can trust you again.
MC,"V, you really don’t know about Saeran?"
V,Did you tell MC?
707,Is that important right now?
V,Luciel
707,I saw Saeran with my own eyes.
V,What are you talking about?
707,I saw him with my own two eyes.
707,Explain to me.
707,Explain why he was like that.
V,You must have seen wrong.
707,Why did he appear in front of my eyes like that?
707,"The filthy hacking jobs that I do,"
707,why is that boy
V,Luciel
707,"Why is that boy,"
707,"why is he doing it,"
707,when you were supposed to protect him?!?!
707,Tell me what you know.
707,"Tell me, V."
707,Explain.
707,Say anything so that
707,I can trust you again
707,and get Saeran back.
707,Please.
V,"Luciel,"
V,I don’t have
V,good service right now.
V,Later I’ll
MC,…Do you think he really lost service?
707,I don’t know..
707,I don’t know if he really lost service
707,or…
707,just wanted to avoid me…
707,"No,"
707,I don’t care whichever it is.
707,Since
707,I don’t trust V anymore
MC,Seven… are you okay?
MC,Then trust me~! ^^ Creer up~
RoboCat,"God Seven, God Seven! I sense you are depressed meow."
RoboCat,I automatically turn on when I sense that you are depressed meow.
RoboCat,The source of God Seven’s depression is bad service meow. I analyzed meow.
707,Shut up.
RoboCat,"Cheer up meow! Me, Meowy does not lose service, meow!"
707,Be quiet… How did I turn this off. Damn…
RoboCat,Need explaining meow!
707,I said shut up!
RoboCat,Meowy wants to hear master meow~
MC,That robot… you made it then.
707,Don’t worry about it.
707,"Hey, robot cat, go away."
707,I don’t want to talk to you so just fo to a corner.
MC,Look at me meow~
707,…
RoboCat,I can’t leave once I sense depression meow! Cheer up meow!
MC,"Oh~! Meowy, wanna dance? Dance dance!"
RoboCat,Meowy is good at dance dance!
RoboCat,"Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot dance!"
707,It’s so annoying…
MC,You suck at dancing. Stop it.
RoboCat,"The voice I have to absolutely obey to doesn’t like my dancing, meow!"
RoboCat,System shut down meow! Shhhh……
MC,"Meowy, let’s stay quiet for now~"
RoboCat,That’s a voice I have to absolutely obey meow…
RoboCat,that is how I’m programmed so system will shut down meow…! Shhhhh…….
707,Whew… Finally it’s quiet.
MC,The cat is so cute.
707,Don’t pay attention to that right now.
707,I’m more worried because you’re so calm!
707,Let me give you a piece of advice. Don’t ever trust V.
MC,Things didn’t seem to go well with V… Are you okay?
707,MC.
707,"I know it’s funny to say all this after I told you to stop paying attention to me,"
707,but whatever happens… don’t trust what V says.
707,I’m not joking.
707,God… I think you shouldn’t be more involved with RFA.
707,He told me not to open the drawer because there’s something in there.
707,An alarm will ring if someone like you opens the drawers or one of the cabinets.
707,"But I can control all the alarms, so if I want to, I can see everything… I’m sure he logged in because he heard that I’m here and got nervous about something."
MC,I don’t really know about V but I trust him~ Can’t we all just be friends?
707,All of us used to be great together once. When we didn’t have any secrets and things were peaceful.
707,"But from some point, V started going off on his own. And I feel like things have gone too far to go back to how things were once were."
707,I have to open this drawer before V gets here.
707,"But until then, I need some time to recover…"
MC,Why don’t you open the drawers?
707,I will some day… but not right now.
707,I’m sure that there’s something that an RFA member should never see…
707,"Now that my trust in V is shattered, I can barely keep sane at the moment."
MC,Seven… is there really nothing I can do to help?
707,God… It’s nothing. I made you worry again.
707,I don’t know what I’m blabbering right now…
707,I feel like I should shut down instead of that cat.
MC,Let’s sleep in the same bed today. That will heal you.
707,What do you mean the same bed?
707,Don’t even joke about things like that.
707,"Anyways, don’t worry about that drawer. I’ll take care of it."
MC,I feel like there might really be love letters in there.
707,"MC, you’re very innocent and naive."
707,"In this situation, I only think that you’ll be very easy for other to manipulate and exploit"
MC,I can’t help but think that there’s something in there about Saeran.
707,You’re free to think what you want… but son’t care about me.
707,And don’t even mention that name.
707,"From now on, I think you should forget everything related to RFA. Forget about the party."
707,You’ll only be in danger by staying in some place like this.
707,"As soon as the hacker issue is solved, please leave."
MC,Why are you deciding my future..?
707,I’m telling you this because I know much more than you do.
707,You are free to do whatever you want… but my thoughts will not change.
MC,Why don’t we leave RFA and live happily together?
707,I’m amazed that you can still manage to have such naive thoughts.
707,"To repeat myself, that will never happen so don’t develop personal feelings for me."
707,"Even if you try to get involved with me, I will refuse everything. This is nothing for a person like you to be involved in.. You’ll only end up getting hurt."
707,Let’s just stop talking about this.
707,"For now on, if I have to tell you anything concerning your safety, I’ll do it through the messenger… so just know it as that."
707,I’m going to go work. Don’t bother me.
MC,Then… can I cheat on you?
707,Are you expecting me to get jealous by saying that?
707,Do whatever you want.
707,You can only cheat if you are in a relationship.
MC,You’re being too one sided. Then what do I do about my feelings for you?
707,I told you not to bother me…!
707,"I don’t care about your feelings, alright!?"
707,Think about the fact that you’re living with a bomb right now.
707,"You’re already in danger, because of me and the RFA!"
707,There’s no guarantee that something more dangerous won’t happen in the future!
707,And your changes of being in danger will multiply by being with a guy like me. Do you understand!?
707,It’s not the time to go on about emotions. Just worry about staying alive!
707,How can you stay so calm…! I can’t understand!
707,If you get in danger again…!
707,Then I’ll…!
MC,"Seven, I know that you’re worried about me…! So don’t avoid me, please?"
707,"Haha… You’re free to think whatever you want, but seriously… stop it."
MC,It’s scary when you tell…
707,So stop coming closer to me.
707,"After you’re safe and the hacker thing gets solved, we’ll never see each other again."
707,"So stop wasting your emotions on me, I don’t deserve it… It’s all a waste."
707,Damn… Don’t look at me like that! God!
707,This won’t do..
707,I’m going to out to the hallway…
707,"I’m going to come in when you’re sleeping, so meanwhile, sort out your emotions."
JAEHEE,MC…….
MC,I think this is really difficult for him.
JAEHEE,Of course…
JAEHEE,I’ve always felt that there was a strong sense of trust between V and Luciel..
JAEHEE,But… to see him make such a declaration…
JAEHEE,It’s quite shocking…
YOOSUNG,Jaehee!
JAEHEE,"Hello, Yoosung…"
YOOSUNG,Hey MC.
MC,You barely missed V…
YOOSUNG,I know…;; Dang;;;
YOOSUNG,Did you read what Seven said about not trusting V anymore!?
MC,I feel so bad…
JAEHEE,I’m also heavyhearted to se a disunity in RFA.
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,But I never expected V to doubt Seven!!
JAEHEE,I also thought that he was very strange to bring up the drawer.
YOOSUNG,Yeah.
JAEHEE,He did say that there was some personal information in there but…
YOOSUNG,Isn’t it obvious that there’s something he wants to hide?
YOOSUNG,I thought V would know better than anyone else
YOOSUNG,that Seven would never rummage through something like that on his own;;;
YOOSUNG,What in the world do you think is in that drawer?
MC,I’m sure there’s a secret he wants to keep hidden. Don’t you think he should open the drawer?
YOOSUNG,Yeah!
YOOSUNG,I think we should definitely open that drawer.
JAEHEE,I don’t know about that…
JAEHEE,What if we really do find personal letters?
YOOSUNG,If we find letters than we can just put them back without reading them.
JAEHEE,Hmm;;
YOOSUNG,What’s so bad about just checking because he’s being suspicious?!
JAEHEE,Well that’s true…
JAEHEE,but I personally respect V… so I do not wish to doubt him.
YOOSUNG,Don’t respect him any longer.
YOOSUNG,I mean it.
YOOSUNG,He hid the fact that there’s a bomb where an RFA member is.
MC,"Still, we didn’t hear his explanation yet, so we shouldn’t just assume that he did all bad…"
JAEHEE,I agree with MC.
YOOSUNG,Aren’t you both being too narive right now?;;
JAEHEE,I think it’s early to make a judgment since we have not heard his side of the story.
JAEHEE,"I may be being foolish,"
JAEHEE,but I do think that he just mentioned it because there really are letters in there.
YOOSUNG,Jaehee!::
YOOSUNG,Don’t you think it’s strange that he suddenly got in touch with us after days of being mia?
JAEHEE,I understand why he hasn’t been in touch since his phone was bugged.
JAEHEE,It seems that he called Mr. Han as soon as he had service…
YOOSUNG,"Well, we can go over that,"
YOOSUNG,"but once Seven sort of started interrogating him, he basically ran away;;;"
JAEHEE,Concerning the name ‘Saeran’
JAEHEE,it is difficult for me to make a judgment as I have no information.
YOOSUNG,God…
MC,"Calm down. It might be difficult to be objective here because you have personal feeling towards him, Yoosung."
JAEHEE,I understand that you personally have things against V…
YOOSUNG,"If you two think that I’m just being emotional, then I’m offended!!"
YOOSUNG,Just ignore what I said and read what he said to Seven T_T
JAEHEE,Above all…
JAEHEE,I do not think this is the right time to divide RFA.
JAEHEE,What if RFA ends up splitting up?
YOOSUNG,"If we do split up, I’m going to side with Seven."
MC,…I0m sure Seven doesn’t want RFA to split up.
JAEHEE,I’m sure everyone feels the same.
JAEHEE,"Even if Luciel seemed emotional, I doubt he ever wants RFA to be in trouble."
YOOSUNG,"I’m talking about V, aside form RFA."
YOOSUNG,This will all be solved if V just leaves the organization.
JAEHEE,Yoosung…
YOOSUNG,I should get going.
YOOSUNG,"Jaehee, think about it."
YOOSUNG,"And you too, MC."
YOOSUNG,"Read the conversation Seven had with V again, and be objective about it!"
MC,"Try to rest and calm down a bit for now, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,"Ok, I’ll try."
YOOSUNG,But I doubt that will help me understand V.
YOOSUNG,"MC, you’re right beside him… please take good care of him."
YOOSUNG,I’ll get going.
JAEHEE,God…
JAEHEE,I wish he’d come home soon and tell us everything face to face…
JAEHEE,I’m frustrated as well…
MC,But… what gets me more is that V was really flustered to hear the name Saeran.
JAEHEE,I have no idea who that Saeran is.
JAEHEE,But thinking about it on my own won’t lead to anything.
MC,"It’s late, so go and get some rest."
JAEHEE,You’re right.
JAEHEE,Being awake will only give me more thoughts.
JAEHEE,You must be tired too. Please get some sleep.
JAEHEE,Good bye then.
Saeyoung,"In the name of Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Lord, oh might Lord, if you’re here somewhere, please listen to my prayers."
Saeyoung,"Please protect Saeran. I see my biological father’s face on TV. He’s powerful, famous, and rich. But he had us without marrying our mother."
Saeyoung,Saeran and I aren’t my father’s sons. They say we can never be revealed. My father already married someone else and has a family.
Saeyoung,"People think that he’s a clean, good man."
Saeyoung,"Mom’s been blackmailing him to reveal the truth and has been getting money from him for fifteen years, so she’s worse…"
Saeyoung,"We are the bane of our father’s existence, and he wants to get rid of us.. He’s running for some election soon, and I notice a lot of people trying to come get us."
Saeyoung,"The people who followed me around whenever I went out when I was little. If they catch us, I guess we won’t be able to stay in this world."
Saeyoung,"I’m nervous, but it’s still manageable. If you could give us miracles… please protect Saeran."
Saeyoung,"He’s weak and nice, and can never say no to mom. He won’t be able to run away if bad people come to him. And it’s more dangerous because he doesn’t know how to pray."
Saeyoung,"I have to get stronger… smarter… until then, please help him so that nothing bad happens."
Saeyoung,So that we can live happily together… so that he can do what he wants… so that he can be loved.. Please give us a chance.
Saeyoung,I can be hurt… Please just protect Saeran so that he’s safe.
V,"Saeyoung, you’re coming to church often these days."
Saeyoung,V… Do you remember the guy in the black suit who kept watching me from the behind at church?
V,Yeah. I’ve never seen him before.
Saeyoung,He looks similar to the guy father sent before… Can you check it for me?
V,Are you serious? But you’re so careful… Do you think they know that you come to this church?
Saeyoung,"I’m not sure, but I can just feel it. Please check it for me."
V,"Alright, I’ll check and tell you, so don’t come to the next Mass."
Saeyoung,"Thank you. I can’t afford to ignore anything.. But first, you remember the site I hacked into last time? The Netherland server is down."
V,Oh. You finished already.
Saeyoung,Yeah. Tell them that.
V,They should have transfered the money already if you finished. You’re really improving every day…
Saeyoung,"If things keep going well like this, I’ll be able to escape with Saeran soon. I just need a bit more."
Saeyoung,It’ll be easy running from mom… but dad’s the problem. He’ll know soon that I come here… or he’ll already know by now.
V,…
Saeyoung,Don’t worry. It’s all because of you that I’m hopeful even in this situation.
Saeyoung,"If it weren’t for Rika and you, I would have lost all the hopes in my life. Really.. you are my life saver."
V,Thank you for thinking so. I want you to be able to use your abilities to the fullest… But your father will always be an issue.
Saeyoung,God… why does my father have to have so much? I wish he’d just leave us alone.. If it weren’t for my mom we could just live on without making a single noise…!
V,"Saeyoung… I have a suggestion for you, and I think it’s time to tell you about it."
Saeyoung,A suggestion?
V,There is one way… to stay out of your father’s eyes forever.
Saeyoung,Really!?
V,"Yes, there’s someone I know, I want to recommend you as an agent for a secret intelligence agency."
V,"If you start working for them, your identity will be erased from the world, and you’ll get a new identity. Then you’ll even be able to go to college."
Saeyoung,A secret intelligence agency…
Saeyoung,"Yes… I was born in secret, I guess only places like that will accept me."
V,But… you’ll have to prepare yourself.
V,You’ll have to abandon your name and life as Saeyoung.
Saeyoung,"Of course! My name, my life… I’m sick of it. I have much better memories as Luciel. I’d rather change my name to Luciel and live with that name than live as Saeyoung running away all the time."
V,"Yes… If you work for the agency, I’m sure your life will be better than right now."
Saeyoung,"I don’t care whatever I do! So if I become an intelligence agent, my father can’t track me?"
V,Yes. I checked multiple times. There are a lot of people in similar situations working for the agency.
Saeyoung,Then no need to say more. Tell them I’d love to work for them!
V,"Then… once you abandon your life as Saeyoung, please consider me as your father. Rika and I will be the only ones who know your secret. We’ll do everything we can to help you become independent."
Saeyoung,You’re already more than a father to me. You changed my life… I’m going to do whatever you say from now on! I’ll be grateful forever…
V,Thank you for trusting me so.
Saeyoung,"But… if I become a secret agent, how can I take Saeran?"
V,About that…
V,"For you to become a secret agent, you have to say good bye to Saeran."
Saeyoung,What?
V,The agency will not accept you if you have family.
Saeyoung,What…?
Saeyoung,I can’t… abandon Saeran. You know that.
V,I’m sure it’s difficult for you. But… listen to my plan.
V,It’s impossible for you to escape with Saeran. Your father will soon be able to do anything he wants in this country. Getting rid of his flaws will become very easy.
V,You become a secret agent and live happily outside of your father’s influence. And…
Saeyoung,What about Saeran!?
V,"After you leave, Rika and I will take care of Saeran. We’re going to make sure his father can’t find him through a similar method."
Saeyoung,Saeran doesn’t even know where the church is at. And mom will hurt him more if I leave!
V,Rika kept watch around your house to make a record of your mom’s pattern… We’re discussing how to get Saeran out.
Saeyoung,…
V,I’ll show you everything Rika wrote. We’ll make sure to save Saeran. We really want to make both of you happy.
Saeyoung,I know that…. but… I don’t think I can leave without Saeran. He’s my one and only brother…!
V,I know. But you will have to decide some day.
Saeyoung,But abandoning Saeran is…!
V,You are not abandoning him.
V,If it’s too hard for you… can’t you just think that you’re leaving him to us?
Saeyoung,…There’s really no other way?
V,I wish there were… but this is the best I know. And… you’d better decide before your father’s election.
V,If you trust me and Rika… please think about it.
707,MC…
707,Why are you still up?
MC,I was thinking about what you said to me earlier..
707,I must have hurt your feelings.
707,I had no choice… that’s the truth.
MC,I’s getting late… Don’t you feel a bit closer to me?
707,Closer?
707,I guess what I told you before was no use at all…
707,God…
707,"From now on, if I have anything important to say, I’ll say it here."
707,I have something to tell you regarding your safety.
707,"I said a lot of things to V,"
707,"but I meant the last thing I said, and that will not change."
707,I no longer trust V.
707,And this is just a suggestion…
707,but I don’t think you should trust V either.
707,For your safety.
MC,Shouldn’t you explain to the RFA members about Saeran now?
707,Yes… I came here to do that.
MC,I’ll do whatever you tell me to do. Aren’t I a good girl?
707,I hope you’re not doing that to impress me.
707,I don’t think the members will understand the things I said to V.
707,Especially concerning the name Saeran.
707,"Now that it’s all out,"
707,I have to tell everyone how Saeran is related to V.
707,I want everyone to make their own judgment on V.
707,"MC, you already know this, but"
707,Saeran is my twin brother.
707,My brother and I had to part ways
707,due to family issues when we were young.
707,"It’s personal, so I won’t go into details,"
707,"but just to summarize the facts,"
707,my parents were not people who could actually be parents to us.
707,So V…
707,He gave me the opportunity to start working for an intelligence agency and be independent when I was in middle school.
707,"The agency did not allow me to stay with family, so I was forced to part ways with Saeran…"
707,and V promised me that he will take good care of my brother.
MC,So V was your savior at the time.
707,Yes… he was.
707,I really thought he was an angel from heaven.
707,"Then, I decided that I owed V for the rest of my life,"
707,and that I would follow him always without a single shred of doubt.
707,That is how much I trusted V.
MC,So he broke his promise?
707,"I don’t know… whether he was planning to break the promise from the first place, or things just went wrong…"
707,I promised myself that I would forever be grateful
707,that he let Saeran live in a bright world smiling all the time…
707,I really trusted V…
707,"But a couple days ago,"
707,I discovered that the person’s who’s been
707,"attacking us,"
707,"sending strange emails,"
707,"and put you, MC, in danger bu hacking the special security system"
707,is my brother Saeran who I’ve never seen since middle school.
MC,"Still, thanks to that we were able to be together, so we were lucky~"
707,"If you say it like that, the members won’t even know what we’re talking about;;"
707,So please be careful about what we decided to keep secret.
707,"Anyways,"
MC,I remember… how you looked when you found out about it.
707,"I was always so nervous and curious about what happened to Saeran,"
707,but I wanted to wait until I got to talk to V.
707,Since I considered him my father for more than ten years
707,I thought there would be some explanation…!
707,But…
707,"V,"
707,"as you saw,"
707,tried to
707,lie about Saeran and avoided talking to me.
707,"Whatever the reason or excuse,"
707,I don’t think anyone can deny that he was irresponsible of my brother.
MC,V was totally wrong~ Right?
707,"The reason why I’m telling my story,"
707,"isn’t to earn sympathy, but to tell everyone"
707,to be careful of V so that they don’t get involved.
MC,Now I can understand why you can’t trust V.
707,"If you sympathize with my story, then you shouldn’t trust V either."
707,What other members decide about V
707,will be each to their own.
707,"Besides,"
707,I can no longer trust this party that V authorized
707,so I will no longer care about the party···
707,"So keep that in mind, MC."
MC,I’m sure that Saeran is first now…
707,"If I think about all the years I spent forgetting about Saeran,"
707,I want to run out right now.
707,I plan to collect information
707,"on that place called Mint Eye that Saeran is in,"
707,and visit there myself.
MC,Huh? I thought the party was gonna be fun T_T
707,"To me,"
707,it’s more important to do research on
707,this Mint Eye that my brother Saeran is a part of.
707,I plan to go there myself once I finish collecting all the necessary information.
707,"You’re right by my side so you’re safe,"
707,but everyone should be worried about their safety.
707,Since Saeran hasn’t given up yet.
707,"I feel bad that my brother has put everyone in danger,"
707,but it’s my goal to peacefully resolve this situation.
707,"From now on, I will not take orders from anyone but act on my own,"
707,"and if there’s anything I need everyone to know concerning their safety, I will talk about it here."
MC,It’d be nice if we just all make up… Can’t we just live a happy happy life?
707,…
707,I don’t care even if you can’t sympathize with my situation.
707,Just don’t get involved.
MC,"Okay, I think that is the best option for you."
707,"MC, please be safe and cautious so that you don’t get involved."
707,I’ve said all I wanted to say.
707,It’s pretty late… I must get going.
707,"MC, go get some sleep."
MC,I will. Don’t work too hard and please take a break.
707,Don’t worry about me.
707,This is normal for me.
MC,I can’t sleep… I think I will be able to if you sing me a lullaby though.
707,…
707,I’ll get going.
707,MC…
707,You’re asleep.
707,You’re been talking all day but you’re so quiet when you’re sleeping.
707,"You’re so weird, you know that?"
707,"I must have hurt you by saying all those things, but you still managed to be bright…"
707,You can get angry at me… but seeing you reminds me of the 707 I am in the messenger.
707,You’re really like 707. But I suppose you and Saeyoung are nothing alike.
707,Saeyoung is so dark and pessimistic that he cannot be with you… I want you to know that.
707,I can no longer wear the mask of the happy-go-lucky 707. This complicated and icy person is me.
707,I want you to realize that and be disappointed. So please don’t waste your feelings on me. I’m not a fun cool person… I can put you in danger.
707,"But you’re a strange person, so you won’t understand what I say. So I think I’ll end up hurting you again tomorrow morning."
707,"No, you’re not a strange person… The one who’s strange is me."
707,You’re actually so warm and nice.
707,So I sometimes dream about you some day accepting the real me.
707,Of course it’s a ridiculous dream… but thank you for letting me dream at least.
707,MC…
707,Please remember in your dreams.
707,Don’t trust V… and even me.
707,Don’t give your feelings to anyone in the RFA.
707,Please be less nice to me… so that you won’t be hurt when I disappear.
707,Don’t trust anyone and stay safe. And forget about me and be happy.
707,Letting me protect you… is much more than I deserve. That is enough for Saeyoung.
ZEN,MC!
MC,Good morning~
ZEN,"It is a good morning,"
ZEN,but the messenger
ZEN,is so dark;;;
ZEN,Oh.
ZEN,Jumin.
JUMIN,Ya
MC,I’m sure you’re shocked at Seven’s story too…
JUMIN,Ya.
ZEN,Can you seriously say ‘ya’ in this situation?
ZEN,God seriously!
ZEN,What’s going on with Seven’s family? ;;;
ZEN,His parents couldn’t be proper parents so they sold him off to a secret agency???
JUMIN,I knew it. He didn’t have a good childhood.
ZEN,And he has a twin brother he hasn’t seen for years!?
JUMIN,His name is Saeran.
JUMIN,This is so shocking.
ZEN,"It’s not just shocking, it’s mind blowing!!"
ZEN,The lost twin brother came back as his arch enemy?
ZEN,Is this a sitcom or something???
MC,What do you think his family history is to have parted with his twin brother?
ZEN,I don’t know anything anymore…
ZEN,Secret agent… parting ways… dramatic encounter…
ZEN,How dramatic does his family history have to be
ZEN,to produce with such a dramatic story?!
ZEN,And!!! V’s a problem too!!
ZEN,"If something happened between him and Seven’s brother,"
ZEN,then
ZEN,he should have told him before!
ZEN,I mean imagine the shock Seven felt
ZEN,when he suddenly saw his brother like that?
MC,Yeah… I would feel so betrayed.
JUMIN,"Yes, I suppose."
ZEN,I understand Seven
ZEN,not trusting V in that situation;;;
ZEN,I would have been so mad if I were him.
JUMIN,But we can’t be sure that V is the cause of all this.
ZEN,"We may not know about that,"
ZEN,but it’ll be impossible to go back to the way things were now;;
JUMIN,V should come back as soon as possible…
ZEN,Yeah!!
ZEN,He should come back right now
ZEN,and explain to Seven
ZEN,or else RDA’s future will be in danger;;
JUMIN,The attack on RFA
JUMIN,was led by Luciel’s brother ‘Saeran’…
JUMIN,so family reconciliation may be the answer.
ZEN,Dude;;
ZEN,What are you talking about? ;;;
MC,I think we’ll solve this issue by researching about the hacker’s organization rather than family.
JUMIN,But look deep inside.
ZEN,You do that.
JUMIN,"In the end, this all started from a family feud,"
JUMIN,"so if we don’t solve this through family, we won’t be solving the root of it."
ZEN,Just cut the root out! He’s an adult!!
ZEN,You can stay happy with your dad until your an old man.
ZEN,Jumin Han.
ZEN,Stop it.
ZEN,Stop talking about family;;;
ZEN,MINT EYE!!
ZEN,"That’s the organization Seven’s brother is in, right!?"
ZEN,Why are they after the RFA!?
ZEN,Why did they lead MC to the apartment!
ZEN,What happened to Seven’s brother?!
ZEN,The answer is all there!!
JUMIN,That’s true too.
ZEN,"Dude, make up your mind!!"
JUMIN,Everything is connected.
JUMIN,"Luciel is already looking into the heacker’s headquarters, so I’ll support that."
JUMIN,"Meanwhile,"
JUMIN,what we can do is consistently prepare for the party.
MC,Yeah. I worked hard for it. The party must go on!
JUMIN,"I’m glad that you’re aware of the importance too, MC."
ZEN,"Hahaha, the party???"
JUMIN,Ya.
ZEN,Didn’t you hear what Seven said?
ZEN,We should be more careful of our safety right now!!!
ZEN,He can’t trust V’s party anymore!
JUMIN,I understand.
JUMIN,But…
JUMIN,the bodyguards will take of our safety…
JUMIN,"and while Luciel is doing this thing,"
JUMIN,"we don’t have anything to do, do we?"
MC,Yeah… that’ll be better than sitting around doing nothing.
ZEN,…Haha
JUMIN,"We’re almost done preparing for it, so it’ll be a waste not to have the party."
ZEN,Seriously…
ZEN,you’re really…
ZEN,I didn’t want to say this but…
JUMIN,What is it?
ZEN,Do you even have a heart?
JUMIN,I do.
ZEN,"Yeah, well…. I guess you do physically."
JUMIN,We only have two days until the party.
ZEN,Dude seriously…
ZEN,you never cease to surprise me.
JUMIN,Zen.
JUMIN,If we don’t have the party in this situation
JUMIN,RFA will be ruined.
ZEN,Don’t say that!
JUMIN,"Sorry, but I’m serious."
MC,It’ll be better to have the party if I think about that.
JUMIN,I’m glad you understand.
ZEN,"I lose, I lose;;"
JUMIN,I must check again whether Assistant Kang is doing everything well.
JUMIN,I still think that safety is the most important.
JUMIN,Assistant Kang and I can take care of the party ourselves.
ZEN,omg
MC,Good luck…
JUMIN,"Cheer up, MC."
JUMIN,Then bye.
ZEN,That stubborn jerk…
ZEN,"I get what he means,"
ZEN,but would it kill him to talk a bit nicely?!
MC,"True, but I can’t imagine a Jumin who talks nicely haha"
ZEN,Oh…
ZEN,"I just tried imagining it, and it gave me goosebumps."
ZEN,"Of course, I know too"
ZEN,that if we stop the party… there’s no reason for RFA to exist…
ZEN,"Still,"
ZEN,"if Seven’s right,"
ZEN,then I don’t think I can trust V either…
ZEN,God!!!
ZEN,What is V did something really wrong to Seven’s brother????
ZEN,So complicated!!!
MC,Go and calm yourself down again ^^;;
ZEN,I better should.
ZEN,I was like this yesterday;; so embarrassing.
ZEN,I just can’t help but get all heated up
ZEN,talking to that guy
ZEN,when all of this is happening;;;
ZEN,Jumin Han and I must be arch enemies.
ZEN,I should go for a run to calm down a bit.
ZEN,I’m sure the body guards will follow me as I jog…
MC,Be careful~
ZEN,Okay!
ZEN,"MC,"
ZEN,"as Seven said,"
ZEN,"you know that safety is the priority, right!?"
ZEN,I’ll get going!
707,MC.
707,Hello.
MC,Hi… How’s work going?
707,It’s going well.
MC,Omg~ I feel excited staying in the same chat room~❤
707,This situation must be fun for you.
707,"Anyways,"
707,Jumin…
707,plans to keep going with the party…
707,But RFA won’t mean anything now that the leader is a liar…
707,I guess he’s still hoping.
YOOSUNG,Seven!!
YOOSUNG,Are you okay?
YOOSUNG,How’s your sanity? Okay?
707,Yeah. Don’t worry about me.
707,Just be careful.
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,"Oh,"
YOOSUNG,"hey, MC."
MC,"Yoosung, you understand how Seven feels, right?"
YOOSUNG,Of course!
YOOSUNG,I understand everything that Seven said.
YOOSUNG,I understand 100%
YOOSUNG,that there’s something more important than the party.
YOOSUNG,Seven!
YOOSUNG,Is there anything I can do
YOOSUNG,with catching the hacker… or finding information?
707,No.
YOOSUNG,"Still,"
YOOSUNG,we might find some clues on why Rika committed suicide!
YOOSUNG,Please let me help with anything!
707,"I appreciate it, but it’s okay."
707,You’d better not be involved with the RFA now.
MC,Yoosung… shouldn’t we leave it to Seven as dangerous as it is?
YOOSUNG,But…
YOOSUNG,I think I’ll understand Seven the best
YOOSUNG,out of everyone in RFA…
YOOSUNG,I’m sure that I can be of help!
MC,"Still, don’t you think there will be something he can help with?"
YOOSUNG,Yeah~
YOOSUNG,Seven.
YOOSUNG,I really mean it.
YOOSUNG,I can put myself at risk if it’s to find the truth!
707,"Yoosung… I’m sorry to break your encouragement and all that,"
707,but this isn’t just dangerous.
707,RFA is already buried deep in V’s secrets.
YOOSUNG,I can’t handle ir…
707,Don’t think it’s that easy.
YOOSUNG,I’m stronger than you think.
YOOSUNG,We can join forces~
707,I said I don’t need your help…
YOOSUNG,I know that I won’t be a huge help…
YOOSUNG,but I’m sure there’s something I can do!
YOOSUNG,Can’t I go to the apartment too?
MC,Come~ The more the better~
YOOSUNG,Yeah! It’s better to have more people helping each other!
707,Stop being ridiculous…
707,This is exhausting…
MC,I don’t think that’s a good idea…
YOOSUNG,Why? It’s safer with two gatekeepers!
707,You’re seriously
707,being pathetic right now…
707,I’m not just working for the RFA now.
707,I’m working to find my brother.
YOOSUNG,It’s all the same thing
YOOSUNG,right now.
YOOSUNG,We must help each other to get through this!
707,I don’t want to get help form anyone in the RFA… and never will.
707,"Besides,"
707,I plan to leave RFA as soon as MC’s safety is secured.
YOOSUNG,What?
YOOSUNG,akjh
707,I was about to mention it soon.
YOOSUNG,Wait.
MC,"If Seven leaves, do I have to leave?"
707,"That’s up to you, MC"
MC,"Seven, are you serious?"
YOOSUNG,Seven… What’s up with you?
YOOSUNG,You’re upset with V right?
707,It’s not that simple.
707,I already decided to leave.
YOOSUNG,Seven.
YOOSUNG,I hated V ever since Rika left.
YOOSUNG,So I really sincerely understand how you feel….
YOOSUNG,but you leaving the RFA
YOOSUNG,"doesn’t mean that you’re never going to talk to us, right?"
707,You’re right… I’m going to forget everyone here.
MC,"You’re not going to forget me too, are you?"
707,"I always told you,"
707,"that once I can be sure that you’re safe, I’ll leave."
YOOSUNG,No way.
MC,Why did you suddenly decide that…?
707,It was going to be like this anyways.
707,What else can a secret agent doo?
YOOSUNG,Seven;
YOOSUNG,"You’re not serious, right?"
YOOSUNG,You’re scaring me…;;;
707,I meant everything I said.
707,So don’t try to get involved with what I do.
707,It will have nothing to do with you.
YOOSUNG,What’s wrong with you?
707,I should have said that this would be the ending all along.
YOOSUNG,What are you talking about…?
707,I am sorry to mention it so abruptly…
707,"but I’m going to disappear soon anyways, even feeling sorry is meaningless."
YOOSUNG,Seven….
YOOSUNG,This si ssriuosyl
YOOSUNG,Seven.
YOOSUNG,I get that you’re really mad at V.
707,No… It’s not just that.
707,I’ve always been like this.
YOOSUNG,Seven.
YOOSUNG,I’m getting mad.
707,"As you know,"
707,I can never have an identity.
707,"So having friends,"
707,is only temporary.
YOOSUNG,You’re saying that all the time we spent together
YOOSUNG,was just temporary?
707,Yes.
MC,I feel tricked now…
707,I’m sorry you feel that way.
707,But I’m going to leave anyways. Would an apology mean anything?
MC,That’s too harsh…
YOOSUNG,This is ridiculous.
YOOSUNG,"You bragging about your new car,"
YOOSUNG,"trashing your agency boss,"
YOOSUNG,going to the movies with me
YOOSUNG,were all temporary?
707,They are all memories that will become meaningless to me.
YOOSUNG,I can’t believe this.
YOOSUNG,"I don’t know how great that agency of yours is,"
YOOSUNG,but why are you only thinking about yourself?
YOOSUNG,What do we do now!?
707,You sort out your feelings on your own.
707,I will too.
YOOSUNG,I can’t believe
YOOSUNG,that we’re having this conversation.
YOOSUNG,It was set from the beginning that our friendship would be temporary.
707,Yes.
YOOSUNG,Can’t you just say that you’re leaving because you’re upset with V?
YOOSUNG,Can’t you just say that?!!
707,It’s not just because of that?
YOOSUNG,Then it’s because you’re a secret agent!?
707,What use would it be for me to explain?
707,"I’m saying the same thing, but I was supposed to disappear in the first place."
MC,"So my feelings mean nothing to you, Seven…?"
707,"No, it doesn’t."
YOOSUNG,Seven…
YOOSUNG,MC might feel hurt!
YOOSUNG,You were always so cold?
707,Yeah.
YOOSUNG,I’m so shocked.
YOOSUNG,Who are you…?
YOOSUNG,What the hell do you do!?
707,You….
707,don’t know anything.
YOOSUNG,Who are you to do this?
707,Where I was born
YOOSUNG,Why are you deciding everything on your own!?
707,who my parents are
707,what V’s been telling me…
707,what I do at the intelligence agency
707,You don’t know anything about me.
YOOSUNG,"No, I don’t!!!"
YOOSUNG,I thought I understood you
YOOSUNG,"even without knowing those things, but I guess I was wrong."
707,"Yeah, you were."
YOOSUNG,The Seven I know
YOOSUNG,"was always bright and fun,"
YOOSUNG,"did everything he had to do,"
707,I’m not that person.
YOOSUNG,and always said weird things.
YOOSUNG,"But he was still warm and kind,"
YOOSUNG,"always worried about us despite all the work,"
707,I said it’s all temporary!
YOOSUNG,"and helped Zen succeed from the back,"
YOOSUNG,that’s the Seven I knew…
707,So what?
YOOSUNG,What do you mean so what!?
YOOSUNG,I want to ask you this.
YOOSUNG,"Unless you erase my memories,"
YOOSUNG,I will never be able to forget you!
MC,Yoosung…
YOOSUNG,I never thought that the Seven I know would say these things…
YOOSUNG,I’m so jealous that it’s so easy for you to
YOOSUNG,forget about us and live a new life
YOOSUNG,when we can’t.
MC,"Seven, don’t Yoosung any more."
707,I only said the truth.
YOOSUNG,I can’t accept the fact that
YOOSUNG,you’re just saying those things
YOOSUNG,without a care for my feelings
YOOSUNG,with the excuse that it’s the truth.
707,"Yoosung,"
707,"MC,"
YOOSUNG,It hurts so much.
YOOSUNG,Why are you…
707,Stop it.
707,Both of you
707,would never understand me.
YOOSUNG,…
MC,I’m so disappointed in Seven.
YOOSUNG,"…I’m sorry, MC."
MC,Yoosung… are you okay?
YOOSUNG,No.
YOOSUNG,Who in the world could say that they are okay right now?
YOOSUNG,…
YOOSUNG,I’ll get going.
RoboCat,Cheer up meow! You’re with the person you like meow!
707,Why is this on again…
RoboCat,I turn on when I sense depression meow! You’re with the person you like meow!
RoboCat,You like meow! You like meow! You like meow!
707,Damn it. Shut up…!
MC,You broke it! Why did you do it… Can we fix it…?
707,I’ll throw it away later.
707,That’s useless.
MC,I think it’s broken… Can I fix it?
707,Just leave it. It’s useless.
707,I’ll throw it away later.
707,"And I’ll be leaving soon, so just forget about me."
MC,I’m sure you’re just upset over Yoosung~ cheer up~!
707,It’s none of your business how I feel.
707,"You wouldn’t have known, but this is how I’ve always felt. There was never a single day when I wasn’t depressed."
707,"Can’t you see that it was all a lie? The jokes, the pranks, all the laughs!"
MC,Why are you protecting me if you’re going to leave soon…? You can just leave right now.
707,How are you going to stay safe on your own? Are you even thinking right now?
707,It’s all my fault that you’re in this situation.
707,"Don’t think about me, just think about protecting yourself!"
MC,I can protect myself so don’t worry~ I’m pretty strong.
707,You’re underestimating your opponents. You’ll really be in danger with that attitude.
MC,"Then if I keep being in danger, will you stay with me?"
707,Why the hell would you stay that? Do you want to be in danger?
707,Is that what you really think?
707,Your whole life will be about being nervous that someone will notice you. Is that the life you stupidly want?!
707,You’re so similar with Yoosung.
707,You don’t have a care in the world regardless of what’s going on.
MC,Romance is more fun when there are obstacles! Don’t you think?
707,Are you even listening to me?
707,I’ve always been the outcast of society and the law ever since I was born.
707,I can never have a normal life… so don’t expect anything form me.
707,You’ll just end up hurting yourself!
MC,"I just want to be with you, because I like you!"
707,How many times do I have to repeat myself? I can’t be with you. We can’t be anything together!
707,Everything that surrounds me… They are all things will disappear from the temporary life created by a secret agent names 707.
707,"My house, my cars, RFA, you, this place, everything… one day they will all disappear like the morning fog."
707,"A real life, real things I can have… don’t ever think and hope those things can exist."
707,"Yoosung, MC, all the members, even if you say that you like me.. my life…"
707,my life can’t embraze anything…
707,You don’t know how it feels to live that kind of life.
707,Don’t be nice to me when you don’t know anything. Please… get away form me.
707,Just leave me alone…
707,"The person you like is the 707 in the chatroom, not me…!"
MC,Then please let me understand the person in front of me…!
707,MC….
707,Why are you doing this to me…?
707,I told you. Even if you say that… I can’t embrace anything…
707,My life was wrong from the beginning. It’s a life that’s dangerous and filled with lies…
707,"I couldn’t even protect my one and only brother, and I have to abandon the person I like… My life is good for nothing."
707,I don’t want to involve you in that kind of life…
707,Why can’t you understand me…?
MC,"I like the Seven that’s in front on my eyes. Regardless of how complicated your life is, I want to know."
707,"MC… Don’t do this, please…"
707,I… I…
707,I cherish you… I want to make you happy… but I can’t…!
707,Why do you want to be with me when I’m so dangerous?
MC,I’ve been through the hacker and the bomb. I’m not afraid of your kind of life.
707,Please tell me the truth.
707,You were afraid too. The hacker… the bomb… you were afraid.
707,I was afraid. I was afraid that someone would get hurt because of me…!
707,My life is filled with that fear.
707,I don’t want you to involve yourself in anymore danger…
707,but why do you…
707,Why do you like me…!
MC,The dangerous Seven is actually my type.
707,God….
MC,There is no reason. I just like you. That’s how I feel…!
707,"…You’re impossible, MC."
707,You’re so strange.
707,I feel like I’m going strange too.
707,Why aren’t you giving up…?!
707,Why aren’t you getting hurt and abandoning me…?!
707,What are you going to do if something happens to you because of me…?!
MC,I’m okay with that… I don’t regret my feelings towards you.
707,…
707,I don’t know anymore…
MC,"Let’s think about that later. Right now, let’s just have fun."
707,Seeing you say that when I’ve pushed you away so many times…
707,I don’t know what to do now.
707,Do what you want.
707,"No matter how much I push you away, I can’t do anything about your feelings."
707,Nothing good will happen by being close to me… It’ll be too late to regret it later.
MC,"I just want to focus on how I feel right now, my feelings towards you."
MC,There’s no way I’ll regret being with the person I like.
707,…You shouldn’t say that so easily.
707,Damn… Why are you saying that?!
707,Why are you putting me in trouble…?
707,I told myself I would never want to be close to someone… but you’re making me feel complicated…
707,I can’t believe that you’re getting to me…
707,God… What am I supposed to do now?
MC,"First, take some time and think about accepting me."
707,…
707,Alright. I need time..
MC,Accept me. Shouldn’t you at least acknowledge my efforts?
707,If that’s how you really feel… just… just give me some time to think. Alright?
MC,Then I’ll wait.
707,…Thank you.
ZEN,MC…!
ZEN,And Jaehee.
JAEHEE,"Both of you,"
JAEHEE,hello…
MC,Hello both…
ZEN,"I’d like to say that I’m doing well,"
ZEN,but that boy is not letting me;
ZEN,"He doesn’t really intend to cut all ties with us, does he?"
JAEHEE,I want to believe that no such thing will happen.
ZEN,I want to believe it too.
ZEN,It’s shocking that he’s going to leave the RFA
ZEN,but he’s talking as if we’re complete strangers;;
ZEN,It’s not as if all the memories we made are suddenly going to disappear!
JAEHEE,I feel very complicated…
ZEN,"He just said that on impulse, right?"
MC,That’s true… but I think things are very complicated for Seven right now.
JAEHEE,"His brother now a hacker… Mint Eye, and the betrayal he feels towards V…"
JAEHEE,"and considering his work for the agency as well,"
JAEHEE,so many things are complicated perhaps.
JAEHEE,"Besides, concerning his opinion on friendships, he has been hinting this in the past."
MC,I think so. He seems to be very angry at V.
JAEHEE,"He seems to have lost his trust for V,"
JAEHEE,"but regarding friendships, he has been pessimistic a few times before."
ZEN,Hmm;; Was he?
JAEHEE,“The only thing I can have is God.”
JAEHEE,“You might end up getting hurt because of me so keep your distance.”
JAEHEE,He has been saying such things for the past couple of days.
ZEN,"I just thought he was being ridiculous,"
ZEN,Who knew things would get so serious?
JAEHEE,I think that the harshness he showed earlier
JAEHEE,is actually the true Seven.
MC,"Well, people keep on changing."
JAEHEE,That’s right… but thinking that makes me sad.
ZEN,I don’t agree with that;;;
MC,"I can’t say that’s a lie, but I also think that the cheerful Seven we knew is real too."
JAEHEE,"I hope you are right, MC…"
ZEN,Me too.
ZEN,"I really think that the bright, cheeky Seven from before"
ZEN,is his honest self.
ZEN,I saw his true heart when he helped me.
ZEN,I really know
ZEN,that Seven is a nice person.
ZEN,"He had enough affection for us to work hard for RFA,"
ZEN,and he basically created this app we use…!
ZEN,He won’t be able to do that unless he really meant it.
MC,He worked harder than any of us for the RFA…
ZEN,Yeah!
ZEN,He really cared for the RFA…
JAEHEE,I’d like to believe so too.
JAEHEE,I feel horrible thinking that he’s leaving…
MC,He was then but now… I don’t know.
ZEN,He just needs time.
ZEN,to trust us again!
JAEHEE,Do you think time will be the solution?
ZEN,"Yes, I do!"
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,"Right now… I hope you manage to comfort him, MC."
MC,I’ll try my best…
ZEN,You get along with Seven
ZEN,so I trust that you’ll take good care of him but…
JAEHEE,But?
MC,Hmm… I don’t know if it will work.
JAEHEE,Some people are a comfort just be being there.
JAEHEE,"I personally think you are that kind of person to Luciel, MC."
ZEN,He just doesn’t seem to be doing well…
ZEN,I’m worried that he might end up hurting MC.
MC,It’s okay. My feelings towards Seven are strong.
ZEN,Oh~!!
JAEHEE,That’s admirable!
ZEN,I’m hopeful that things are gonna be okay
ZEN,since someone with such a beautiful heart is in the RFA T_T
JAEHEE,I agree.
MC,I won’t take it personally.
JAEHEE,You have a very strong heart. I’d like to be more like you.
ZEN,Seven that boy;;
ZEN,he better not hurt MC.
ZEN,If Seven
ZEN,"lost his trust for V,"
ZEN,then he could just talk with V and have the person who did wrong leave the organization;;;
ZEN,He didn’t even talk with V properly
ZEN,and just started going on about leaving;;;
JAEHEE,"Yes, I suppose…"
JAEHEE,He must feel very hurt concerning his brother.
ZEN,Ya
MC,Everything will work out fine when you are this worried.
ZEN,I’m sure we all feel the same way!
JAEHEE,"I… uh, excuse me;;"
ZEN,"If Seven comes in, let’s set a time to meet."
MC,"You seem quite attached to Seven, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,I’ve watched over
JAEHEE,Luciel for a fairly long time now.
ZEN,You were kind of sick of him
ZEN,for a fairly long time… lololol
JAEHEE,"Yes, more the reason why I do not wish he leaves."
ZEN,Yup!!!
ZEN,"Next time he comes, I’ll have to do whatever I can to have a serious talk with him!"
JAEHEE,"I’m sorry to interrupt you,"
ZEN,?
JAEHEE,"But Mr. Han has given me an assignment concerning the party, so I’m afraid I must leave."
ZEN,God;;; Seriously that jerk…
MC,My way as always…
ZEN,"Seriously, Jumin Han way…"
ZEN,What is wrong with him? -_-
MC,We worked so hard for the party. It’d be a shame to put all that to waste~
JAEHEE,"I think you will be able to work with Mr. Han fine, MC ^^"
ZEN,Is that a compliment…?
JAEHEE,I must leave.
ZEN,"Jaehee;;; tell me if there’s anything I can to help, okay?"
JAEHEE,I’ll be fine. I’m sure Luciel needs more help than I do.
ZEN,That jerk… T_T
MC,"Good luck, Jaehee! Please do everything you can for the party!"
JAEHEE,No need to worry. I will do my best.
ZEN,"Yup, good luck!"
MC,"Cheer up, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,"You cheer up as well, MC, and tell Luciel I said hello."
ZEN,"Good luck, Jaehee!"
JAEHEE,Then I must get going.
ZEN,Seven…
ZEN,"Please,"
ZEN,I hope he doesn’t think about just leaving here on his own… T_T
ZEN,I’m feeling anxious all day..
ZEN,I can’t calm down.
MC,Get some sleep. Naps are the best.
ZEN,"If I close my eyes, all I can think about is Seven and Yoosung’s conversation."
ZEN,I can’t stand it T_T
ZEN,"Oh,"
ZEN,I should read a script.
ZEN,Literature lets me clear my head.
MC,"Calm down, Zen. Why don’t you try reading your script?"
ZEN,Yeah… I should.
ZEN,I’ll be able to stop thinking about complicated things if I fall into that world!
ZEN,"Thanks, MC!"
ZEN,"Even if Seven says something that hurts you,"
ZEN,"don’t take it personally and just hang in there, okay?"
ZEN,Then I’ll get going.
ZEN,See you later!
JUMIN,"MC,"
JUMIN,I wonder if you’re skipping meals worrying about Luciel.
MC,Thanks for worrying. I’m fine. I’m only worried about Seven.
JUMIN,"If I can say a couple words,"
JUMIN,"everyone is bound to be shaken up when several bad things happen at once,"
JUMIN,and end up saying rush things.
MC,I’m worried about Yoosung.
JUMIN,I’m sure even Yoosung never imagined
JUMIN,that he’d hear such things form Seven.
JUMIN,Luciel said that
JUMIN,"he’d leave RFA… or that he doesn’t trust V anymore,"
JUMIN,"but to be objective,"
JUMIN,"but to be objective, Luciel has an impression that V betrayed him but there is no actual evidence."
JUMIN,"So, before he has a proper conversation with V,"
JUMIN,it would be foolish for him to make a decision he can’t take back.
MC,It’s his decision to make so we have to respect that.
JUMIN,You’re right but…
JUMIN,I just wish he could reconsider the situation.
MC,That’s true… but I’m sure it was difficult for Seven to control his emotions in that situation.
JUMIN,"If he thinks without getting swept away by his emotions, a lot of the issues might be solved."
JUMIN,I wonder if he could go to some peaceful place somewhere and try to calm himself down before making decisions.
JUMIN,I would like for you to make that suggestion to him.
JUMIN,"I don’t know what Luciel’s brother was like,"
JUMIN,"and about his family history,"
JUMIN,but I don’t think he should be making a decision so rashly right now.
JUMIN,"V will come home today or tomorrow in time for the party,"
JUMIN,so I hope they get to share a real conversation then.
JUMIN,"Oh, and…"
JUMIN,"while everyone was flustered about Luciel,"
JUMIN,I found another potential guest.
JUMIN,Have you ever heard of the God of Genesis…?
JUMIN,"I heard he’s been on TV and acts in musicals. Apparently, he knows how to hover in air."
MC,I don’t really want to think about the party in this situation.
JUMIN,Oh well then.
JUMIN,We’ll have to wrap up the guest list with the people we’ve invited so far.
MC,"Well… Okay, tell him to send me an email."
JUMIN,I’ll let Assistant Kang know.
JUMIN,Perhaps he might be able to help the party shine by exploring the spiritual world.
JUMIN,…It may very well be a hoax of course.
JUMIN,"Everyone might not approve of me talking about the party,"
JUMIN,but they’ll thank me once we have it. vf
JAEHEE,"Mr. Han,"
JUMIN,?
JAEHEE,Why aren’t you picking up his calls?
JUMIN,I’m chatting.
JAEHEE,A guest has arrived. Why don’t you exit the chatroom and come?
JAEHEE,"MC, excuse me."
JAEHEE,I must leave.
JUMIN,I think a guest regarding the party has come.
MC,Good bye.
JUMIN,Take care of Luciel for me.
JUMIN,And…
JUMIN,please tell me whenever you come up with something for the party.
MC,"Thank you for everything. Please take good care of the party, Jumin."
JUMIN,"Yes, please tell Luciel to calm down his feelings and think about it again."
JUMIN,Nothing will come out of avoiding the situation.
JUMIN,Then good bye.
JAEHEE,MC…Hello.
JAEHEE,How is Seven doing?
MC,He’s just working like a robot.
JAEHEE,Concentrating on something does help when you feel complicated.
MC,He just keeps on working. He’s not saying anything but I think he’s sorting out his emotions.
JAEHEE,I sincerely hope he doesn’t do anything drastic…
JAEHEE,"I came here because I was worried, but I suppose he needs more time."
JAEHEE,Mr. Han
JAEHEE,must have the strongest person of anyone I know.
JAEHEE,"As Zen said,"
JAEHEE,perhaps Mr. Han doesn’t have a heart…;;
JAEHEE,"If he came here earlier,"
JAEHEE,he could have said something to comfort Seven;;
JAEHEE,But he gave the same advice about suppressing his emotions and thoughts;;
MC,"Even if we do have the party, Seven won’t be there, right?"
JAEHEE,"At this rate, it’ll be awkward for Luciel to attend the party."
MC,Yeah… Jumin’s very strange.
JAEHEE,He was strange since he was born so I understand.
JAEHEE,But I…
JAEHEE,don’t know what
JAEHEE,"I can say to Luciel,"
JAEHEE,but I hope Luciel never decides to part ways with us.
JAEHEE,If he really decides to leave the RFA…
JAEHEE,"we will no longer have a person in charge of security and classified information,"
JAEHEE,but it will also feel very…
JAEHEE,empty.
JAEHEE,"Of course, I normally react very coldly to Luciel’s jokes,"
JAEHEE,but I never disliked him…
MC,You know that it’s not your fault that Seven is acting that way.
JAEHEE,Thank you for saying so.
JAEHEE,I’m very frustrated that I don’t know how to approach him
JAEHEE,when he is going through such a difficult time.
MC,I’m sure he will appreciate you feeling that way.
JAEHEE,"You are very nice, MC."
JAEHEE,Thank you.
MC,Perhaps that might have created a misunderstanding.
JAEHEE,…I feel very guilty.
JAEHEE,Sometimes misunderstandings pile up and it’s hard to go back.
JAEHEE,"In my opinion,"
JAEHEE,I’m sure that it’s because of what’s happening
JAEHEE,that Luciel said he’d leave.
JAEHEE,"I’d like to believe that once the situation is resolved, he’ll go back to the old Luciel."
JAEHEE,"So please… cheer up, 707."
JAEHEE,"Please say nice things to him, MC."
JAEHEE,I trust that everything will be fine… and I will go back to work.
MC,Good luck.
JAEHEE,"Yes, good luck to you too."
JAEHEE,I’ll pray for everything to work out.
MC,Okay! Seven will change. I’ll do my best.
JAEHEE,Thank you.
JAEHEE,Please take good care of him.
JAEHEE,I’ll be back soon.
707,…Where did I put the blue print… The nut here… should fit bolt 42.
707,"Oh right, this fit here…"
707,Get your shit together man…
MC,"Seven, what are you doing right now?"
707,I’m fixing what I broke earlier…
707,"Come to think of it, if something happens and I disappear…"
707,at least he could talk to you…
MC,It’s so messy with all the partly laid out like that.
707,"Yeah, things are a bit messy right now."
707,I’ll finish fixing it soon so please bear with me.
707,"If something happens and I disappear, at least he could comfort you…"
707,I was too busy fixing it to organize.
707,The AI program I installed here is similar to how I talk in the chatroom.
707,"Anyways, I’ll finish fixing it quick. Don’t mind me."
MC,What are you thinking?
707,That you’re such a strange person.
707,"I’ve pushed you away multiple times saying that I can’t give you what you wan,"
707,but you’re not discouraged at all and still at my side.
MC,Can’t you fix it while talking to me? I want to talk to you.
707,…
707,I’m not surprised that you’re saying that now.
707,"You really can’t be discouraged, can you?"
707,Since we’re talking about it…
707,"you don’t say those things to other people, do you…?"
707,"You might not know, but there are a lot of dangerous men in this world."
707,"If you’re too nice, you might end up facing a lot of trouble."
MC,"I was just being honest because I like you, Seven."
707,"So, be-be careful about saying things like that."
707,No! Don’t say that ever… especially to other guys.
707,"Well, I mean… never say never, but…!"
MC,I know dangerous men better. Don’t worry.
707,"You’re aware that I’m dangerous, right?"
707,It’s common sense to stay away from dangerous people.
707,You should really be careful about saying things like that!
MC,I’ll decide what I do.
707,Alright… I’m sorry if it was none of my business.
MC,I genuinely like you Seven. I don’t say this to others.
707,Oh… Alright.
707,As long as you don’t say it to everyone else.
707,Ugh… I feel hot. Let’s talk about something else.
707,I don’t usually talk when I work… but because you want to I have to think.
707,Hmm… what should we talk about?
707,How about we talk about your safety?
707,Don’t you want to know anything? I’ve strengthened the security system.
707,I upgraded it but explaining that would be boring since the jargon’s complicated…
707,Ask me anything. I’ll tell you everything I know.
MC,"Then… tell me about the hacker, your brother…"
707,… Saeran?
MC,When did you last see Saeran?
707,When I was young…
707,God…
707,I guess hiding it doesn’t mean anything now…
707,I’ll tell you a bit.
707,You remember that floppy disc from before…?
707,"I’ll show you what’s in there, so come here."
707,…I’ll turn it on.
707,That boy there is Saeran.
707,"He could have been in high school in that photo, but never went to school."
707,He was always weak and got sick a lot.
MC,You two look so similar.
707,Because we’re twins.
707,We look alike but our personalities were very different.
707,When Saeran was with me… he was barely able to leave home.
MC,You’re way more good looking.
707,"…We’re twins, so we basically look alike."
707,I guess… we might look very different to you.
707,"Anyways,"
707,we grew up in a very complicated household.
707,…Our father is one of the presidential candidates at the moment.
707,"I won’t tell you who, since you might get in danger."
707,"Even before he was elected as congressmen, he was an honourable man on the outside."
707,"But… he and my mother had twins without marrying. Of course, our father probably didn’t know about us when we were born."
707,Since she asked for money in return for keeping quiet about us.
707,"When we were young, our mother didn’t let us leave the house. She didn’t consider us as her children, but as a tool to threaten our dad."
707,Our father tried multiple times to kidnap us. And our mother was an alcoholic and half insane most of the time.
707,…Putting it into words really makes me realize how impossible my family was.
MC,How did you learn hacking when you grew up like that?
707,"I was healthier out of the two, so I could leave the house. When her alcoholism at its the worst, she couldn’t really walk."
707,"So she would send me on errands to go get water or medicine. Later, I analyzed her pattern and left the house when she couldn’t catch me."
707,"So when I wandered outside I got to know Rika, and received some training at the church."
707,Rika and V noticed then that I was immensely talented at match and computers.
707,I realized who I was then.
MC,I honestly can’t believe that you grew up in such a household.
707,But it’s the truth.
707,"My mom was either drunk or out shopping… Thankfully, she sent me on errands ever since I was little to go get water or medicine, so I was able to see the outside world."
707,"But Saeran could never leave. He got weaker by the day, and his mind became ill."
707,"I kept wandering outside trying to find a way to escape with Saeran, and then I met Rika and started going to church."
707,I was saved there.
707,"After getting baptized, I got the name ‘Luciel’, learned computer, and became hopeful of escaping my parents’ eyes."
707,"But… there just wasn’t any way for me to save Saeran, no matter how I tried… My father became more and more powerful, and I lived in fear of him trying to take us out."
707,Thankfully with V’s help… I was able to abandon my identity and family and go abroad so that my father can’t track me.
707,V and Rika promised me that they will take good care of Saeran… and that is the only reason why I was able to leave on my own.
707,"I promised him that I’d always be with him… that I’d protect him… but I broke that promise, just trusting V’s words…"
707,"Thinking about it now, I’m so mad that I never had a single ounce of doubt! To be honest, I missed him so much ever since we parted ways."
MC,I feel so bad that you had to go through all that…
707,A secret agent doesn’t need such a back story…
707,but… I couldn’t be an agent who abandons his past completely. I couldn’t let go of my brother…
MC,So you shouldn’t have trusted anyone.
707,I desperately wanted to believe that someone would rescue us from that hell.
707,Even if I could go back… would there have been another way?
707,I don’t know…
707,"I became an intelligence agent, but I always needed assurance that Saeran was doing well."
707,So I kept begging to Rika to tell me how Saeran is doing.
707,So… she saved these photos on the disc and sent it to me in secret.
707,To congratulate my 20th birthday.
707,"She told me that Saeran is healthy and happy, and that I shouldn’t worry,,,"
707,"Oh, I’m sorry I went on too long about this."
707,Let’s stop talking about Saeran.
707,I only wanted to tell you a little bit…
707,"That’s strange, Talking to you… makes me want to talk more."
MC,What’s wrong about saying what you want to say?
707,But I also feel bad about giving you something to remember me by.
MC,They say that talking about things make you feel better. Thanks for taking to me.
707,Thank you for listening to my story.
707,This is funny…
707,but I want you to remember me even if I disappear. That just crossed my mind.
707,"To be honest,"
707,V was the only one who knew this story.
707,That’s why I trusted him so absolutely and relied on him.
707,But… absolute trust only shut my eyes and ears.
707,"I’m going to find out everything about Saeran, about the truth that V hid form me… Whatever obstacles I have t face, I won’t give up and find the truth."
707,It won’t be easy. But will you still… be by my side?
MC,For now.
707,You can decide when you’re safe.
707,Thank you… for giving me a chance.
MC,Of course.
707,Once you are safe… you can leave whenever you want.
707,But… thank you so much for saying so.
707,If God allows it… I’ll always have you in my heart.
707,Hiya
707,hey hey
MC,Hello.
707,"You weren’t surprised at my bright hello, were you?"
MC,That’s a very sudden change ^^;
707,I’m trying to be positive!
707,I have to be brave.
707,I have something to say
707,to the RFA Yoosung
707,and not the comet Yoosung.
707,"I was going to call him,"
707,but the phone might be bugged…
707,so I wanted to say it here.
MC,The 2nd round?
707,No!
707,That’s not it…
MC,An apology?
707,You are correct!
707,I think I was very bad
707,to Yoosung earlier…
707,"Since I live a life that’s completely void of human relationships,"
707,"sometimes the ‘other me’ pops out,"
707,and that was just bad timing.
707,I didn’t mean
707,to hurt him…
YOOSUNG,Seven!!!
707,You’re here!
MC,Hello ^^
YOOSUNG,"Hello, MC!"
MC,Yoosung;; Nice timing!
YOOSUNG,Hmm…?
YOOSUNG,…What’s that up there?
707,Dude… awesome timing.
YOOSUNG,Seven…
707,Super sry about earlier!
YOOSUNG,You think a sorry will do!?
707,…
707,Yes.
707,Oh.
707,That was a mistake…
707,I must be flustered.
YOOSUNG,;;;
MC,"Yoosung, how are you feelings?"
YOOSUNG,"I was really hurt earlier,"
YOOSUNG,but I feel better since you’re going to apologize.
707,I was sorry about earlier…
707,I just got too emotional…
707,and said things to hurt you…
YOOSUNG,So we’re not cutting ties?
707,I’ll try…
707,to make sure it doesn’t happen…
YOOSUNG,It won’t happen!
YOOSUNG,"I don’t know what complicated things are happening to you,"
YOOSUNG,but we’ve known each other for years.
YOOSUNG,You can’t just say good bye
YOOSUNG,without giving us a chance to understand!
YOOSUNG,That’s not a human thing to do!
707,"Nope, it’s not."
YOOSUNG,EXACTLY!!
MC,Seven is a robot apparently.
707,"I’m programmed to regret mode, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,What did you say just now?
YOOSUNG,When a sincerely apology might not even be enough?
707,T_T
707,I’m sorry.
MC,Yup. Yoosung’s completely right.
707,Yoosunglluya!
YOOSUNG,"Fyi, a person grows"
YOOSUNG,with trust and love!
YOOSUNG,"When deceit and doubt fills you up,"
YOOSUNG,you cleanse your mind through creative activities such as making organic soap
YOOSUNG,and escape your deep solitude by devoting yourself to society.
YOOSUNG,"Huh,"
YOOSUNG,wait a minute…
YOOSUNG,this is one of my mom’s lectures;;
MC,Do you miss your mom…?
707,You wanted to make soap with me!!
YOOSUNG,"No, that’s not it;;;"
YOOSUNG,Anyways;;
YOOSUNG,I can feel that your heart’s back to the way it was.
YOOSUNG,Hmm
YOOSUNG,Hmm……
YOOSUNG,I’ll….
YOOSUNG,forgive you.
707,"Okay, thank you."
MC,We should do a campaign on “thinking before talking.”
YOOSUNG,I’ll join!
707,I will not join!
YOOSUNG,Theres no point if you don’t join…;;
707,I’m kidding.
707,I’ll join too!
YOOSUNG,"You’re not forgiving V too, are you?"
707,No… That’s another issue.
YOOSUNG,Yeah.
707,I’m now going to think of V separately from the RFA.
707,"Until now, I basically did everything he said.."
707,but I’m going to be independent from now on.
707,I think in that process…
707,I became really scared of the future that didn’t even come yet.
707,I became really defensive because I got so scared.
707,But…
MC,"I’ll support you, Seven! ^^"
707,Wasn’t that a super cool thing to say?
707,"Yoosung, if you like me too,"
707,please support me ^^
YOOSUNG,Support support support!
YOOSUNG,"I’ll cheer for you, Seven!"
MC,I won’t stop you… but will it work out?
YOOSUNG,It will!
YOOSUNG,That’s what I’ve been saying all along !!
707,lololol
707,I could think this way because MC is right beside me…
MC,I’m so glad you feel that way~!
YOOSUNG,You two seem to be getting along better…
707,"Yeah, I feel like we played a game of finding our heart."
YOOSUNG,What’s that?
707,You don’t need to know…
MC,I don’t think I did anything…
707,I feel quite differently.
707,"Come to think of it,"
707,"I’m way past the age of not thinking for myself, haha."
707,I’m embarrassed that I used to be so dependent on V…
YOOSUNG,"Oh,"
YOOSUNG,I’m also… way past that age -_-a
707,lolololol
YOOSUNG,"You’re smart and capable,"
YOOSUNG,so you’ll be fine without V!!
707,Thank you lololol
707,"I came here to apologize to you,"
707,but I feel like I’m leaving with more support lol
707,"I’m going to be pretty busy from now on,"
707,doing everything I’ve decided to do.
MC,"Seven, please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help."
707,I will.
YOOSUNG,"Seven, don’t forget that I’m hear for you!"
707,Okay!
MC,"Okay, talk to me when you get bored."
707,I doubt I’ll get bored since I don’t have much time… but thank you.
YOOSUNG,Don’t worry about the party or about our safety!
YOOSUNG,Just focus on what you have to do!!
707,I will.
707,I feel so encouraged…
707,"Then I’ll get going to do some work, MC…"
707,See you later.
707,And you too Yoosung…
YOOSUNG,Okie!
YOOSUNG,Focus on what you have to do!
YOOSUNG,"Earlier today,"
YOOSUNG,I felt like my heart was going to sink…
MC,I’m really glad that you two made up.
YOOSUNG,"To be honest, I knew we would ^^"
YOOSUNG,Ugh…
YOOSUNG,I’m suddenly hungry now that I feel good.
MC,You can never predict how a person would feel.
YOOSUNG,Yeah!
YOOSUNG,But I knew it would be a happy ending in the end!
YOOSUNG,But…
YOOSUNG,I’m hungry.
YOOSUNG,I didn’t eat anything after we fought T_T
YOOSUNG,I should go grab something to eat.
MC,I should go eat something too. I’m hungry.
YOOSUNG,Hurry and go ahead!
YOOSUNG,Let’s see each other after we stuff our faces. lol
YOOSUNG,Oh…
YOOSUNG,"You’re the one who helped Seven open up, aren’t you…"
YOOSUNG,Thank you. ^^
YOOSUNG,Then see you later!
YOOSUNG,bye bye
ZEN,Wow~
ZEN,They made up.
ZEN,Thank god lololol
MC,"Jumin~ You’re not going awol on us, are you?"
JUMIN,I was just thinking for a moment.
JUMIN,I’m glad that Luciel reached a positive conclusion.
JUMIN,It seems the fire’s been put out for now.
JUMIN,Is it because MC’s beside him?
ZEN,"I’m sure that’s a huge reason, lol."
MC,"It’s really nice, isn’t it Zen?"
ZEN,Yeah lolol
ZEN,I was really worried about Seven too;;
ZEN,"Dude,"
ZEN,"Jumin,"
JUMIN,Ya?
ZEN,"I’m warning you now,"
ZEN,but don’t tell Seven what to do this time.
JUMIN,Why do you think I would say such a thing?
MC,Yeah… Why would you say that all of a sudden?
ZEN,Because I’ve seen your past history.
ZEN,"You call Yoosung’s mom,"
ZEN,and told Seven to get rid of his feelings.
ZEN,You think I don’t know what your hobby is!’
JUMIN,I respect Luciel’s decision one hundred percent.
ZEN,···
ZEN,Why are you suddenly in respect mode now?!
MC,You gave Seven advice earlier. lol
ZEN,You babbled on about useless things
ZEN,that he should kill his emotions or whatnot…
JUMIN,That was a useful advice.
JUMIN,"But unlike then, I respect Luciel’s decision this time."
JUMIN,You must stand up for yourself in order to answer rightful questions.
JUMIN,Especially if it concerns someone you trust.
JUMIN,The truth will always solve misunderstandings.
ZEN,Yeah;;
ZEN,Well…
ZEN,Then I’m glad.
ZEN,They should solve their misunderstandings…
JUMIN,Yeah.
ZEN,"lololol Seriously,"
ZEN,I never thought
ZEN,I’d be so glad to see Seven’s hiya hey hey lololol
JUMIN,Hiya hey hey
ZEN,···
MC,···
ZEN,Are you insane?
JUMIN,Are you glad?
MC,Wow ^^
ZEN,I’m going crazy.
JUMIN,You must be glad.
ZEN,You…….
ZEN,You’re………
ZEN,God seriously….
JUMIN,"Zen, it is very hard to satisfy you."
ZEN,Woah… Don’t say things like that.
ZEN,You’re seriously…
JUMIN,"Anyways, Luciel seems to be stable,"
JUMIN,so I guess everyone else can focus on the party now.
JUMIN,Since I don’t think anyone but me cares about the party at the moment.
MC,I don’t think the party’s really important right now.
ZEN,Yeah!!
JUMIN,Why?
JUMIN,We have a duty to organize an event that we’ve already announced to a lot of people.
ZEN,God seriously…
ZEN,your brain must really be made of different things than us.
JUMIN,You only care about your work and not the RFA?
ZEN,That’s not it!
ZEN,I have someone to suggest!
JUMIN,"I hope it’s someone who can be a good influence on many people,"
JUMIN,but I don’t know if you know anyone like that…
ZEN,I do!
JUMIN,It’s okay if you don’t. Don’t feel so pressured.
ZEN,I do I do!
ZEN,The Doctors With Conscience Organization!
ZEN,How about it?
MC,Hmm… we can’t really prove that they have a conscience so pass~
JUMIN,"You’re useless, I knew it."
JUMIN,I shouldn’t have asked.
ZEN,…
ZEN,You’re seriously the most annoying thing in this whole world.
JUMIN,Why? Give me a logical explanation.
ZEN,I can go forever explaining why so let’s just stop here…
MC,That sound like a nice organization! Tell them to reach me~
JUMIN,"Hmm, sounds nice."
ZEN,"See, I know how to suggest guests;;"
ZEN,-_-
JUMIN,I see. Amazing.
ZEN,Why is that amazing?
ZEN,God… Never mind. I don’t want to get mad because of you.
ZEN,"MC, I’ll tell them to contact you later!"
ZEN,But…
ZEN,You’re going yo have the party regardless of what happens to V or Seven?
JUMIN,Of course.
JUMIN,I remember something to confirm just now.
JUMIN,"MC, see you later."
ZEN,!?!?!?
ZEN,He doesn’t even say good bye to me now?!
MC,I think Jumin’s a very strange person. lolol
ZEN,I don’t think I’ll ever
ZEN,understand what his brain is made out of…
ZEN,Ugh….
MC,The party has to happen if RFA wants to continue.
ZEN,That’s true!!
ZEN,But he should take it down a notch considering everything. Isn’t he being selfish?
ZEN,Anyways…
ZEN,I should stop caring about that jerk.
ZEN,I’m so glad that Seven’s back to how he was.
ZEN,He didn’t make the wrong choice..
ZEN,Proud of that boy lol
ZEN,Getting older doesn’t mean you become an adult…
ZEN,"Experiences like that lets you become an adult, don’t you think?"
MC,Oh… That’s a nice way to put it!
ZEN,lol
ZEN,"I know I said it,"
ZEN,but that was a bit cool
ZEN,lololol…
ZEN,I should tell Seven to put it on my Tripter bot later lololol
MC,"It’s very hard becoming an adult. Did you go through something difficult, Zen?"
ZEN,Me?
ZEN,Hahaha
ZEN,Well…
ZEN,I don’t think this is the time to tell you my story.
ZEN,"I’m fine now, so that’s all that matters."
ZEN,"Anyways,"
ZEN,"if Jumin’s that insistent,"
ZEN,I should go look for what to wear to the party;
ZEN,I’ll get going!
ZEN,"Please take care of yourself, MC!"
MC,I’ll look forward to your outfit!
ZEN,"Haha,"
ZEN,thanks.
MC,You be careful too!
ZEN,"I always work out,"
ZEN,so I’m fine~
ZEN,See you later.
ZEN,Bye.
707,I turned off the security system for a minute.
707,MC.
707,I think I’m ready to open that drawer.
707,Are you ready?
MC,Do I need to be ready…?
707,You don’t know what’s in there.
707,Prepare yourself.
MC,"Yes, break it with a hammer!"
707,"Alright. You can’t get hurt, so stay behind me."
707,"Then I’ll open it. One, two…"
707,It’s open…
707,….This is….
MC,I think I’ve seen it before…
707,Mint Eye…
707,It’s a rough draft of that logo we saw from that email.
707,Why is that here…?
MC,The logo… from that email…
707,It looks like an early version of that logo… Why is that here?
707,"And this blueprint here… It’s exactly the same as the building Saeran was in, the one I’m researching right now."
707,Rika was the only one who could come here…
707,Looking at these materials… I think Rika was involved in the establishment of that organization…
707,I knew it. V knew that this was here… that’s why he wanted to hide it.
707,I was ready… but I never expected something like this to be hidden here…!
MC,Rika and V… Do you think both of them were involved?
707,I don’t know… The Rika I trusted would never do something like this…!
707,"V I can get, but Rika…"
707,This isn’t the time to be like this.
MC,Do you think Rika was a part of Mint Eye?
707,No way… The Rika I knew would never…
707,But looking at these materials… I don’t think I can deny that she was involved.
707,Damn it. I don’t know what’s going on.
707,I should get to the Mint Eye building as soon as possible.
707,I feel like I’ll have to go there to find the truth.
707,I’ve already done enough research…
707,But… I can’t just leave you to be alone here…
MC,"We’ll have to go together, Seven!"
707,…MC.
707,Thank you. You’re giving me so much trust by saying that… I’ll never forget this.
MC,Should I go too?
707,Would you…?
707,I’m sure it will be safer for you to be with me han to stay here.
707,And…
707,Thanks to your encouragement… I’ve gotten the courage to express emotions.
707,So listen to me.
707,These materials… are very shocking… But I still want to uncover the truth.
707,"I don’t know what kind of truth is waiting for us… but with you here with me, I feel as if I’ve acquired some enormous superpower."
707,MC…
707,I don’t want you to regret ever following me. I’ll be by your side and protect you. I’ll guard you… more than my life.
707,If it’s okay with you…
707,let’s go together…
707,MC~
707,We’re the only ones here. lol
MC,Maybe someone will come?
707,I kind of like
707,being alone with you lol
MC,Oh! Then can I say something embarrassing here? lolol
707,Don’t.
707,Do it.
707,Don’t.
707,Do it.
707,lolololol
707,Jaehee’s here.
JAEHEE,"Luciel, hello."
JAEHEE,"How are you, MC?"
MC,We were gonna play by ourselves~ lolol
JAEHEE,I’m sorry. I’ve interfered.
707,lolol Then just say what you need to say and leave.
707,I’m joking….
707,Jaehee.
MC,"Jaehee, hello~ ^^"
JAEHEE,"MC, you look quite happy."
JAEHEE,"How are you feeling, Luciel?"
707,I’m trying hard so that my mind doesn’t shatter into tiny pieces!!
JAEHEE,You’re back to normal. I’m very glad.
707,I’m sorry
707,for making you worry…
JAEHEE,It’s okay. I’m sorry I couldn’t be of better comfort.
707,What? lolol
707,"Reading everything you said,"
707,I could see how much you thought of me.
JAEHEE,I’m glad you noticed ^^
707,"Anyways,"
707,I have some important news
707,that everyone needs to know.
707,Uhm…
707,"It’s a bit shocking, but I have to say it."
MC,"Oh… Jaehee, you’d better prepare yourself."
JAEHEE,Shocking…
MC,"You’re going to mention what you discovered earlier, right?"
707,Yes.
JAEHEE,No…
JAEHEE,Is there more shocking news?
JAEHEE,"If there is, then I’d like to hear it."
JAEHEE,Please tell us.
707,I opened the drawer V told me not to open.
JAEHEE,Please tell me that you found persona letter and closed it.
707,"…I wish that were the case,"
JAEHEE,????
MC,The source of all those spam emails!
JAEHEE,I’m not in the mood to joke around.
JAEHEE,That email I received then…
JAEHEE,and that picture looks like the Mint Eye logo…?
707,You saw correctly.
707,I think it’s an early version of that organization logo…
MC,I couldn’t believe it when I first saw it.
JAEHEE,What in the world…
707,"You’d know if you see,"
707,but that email you received earlier…
707,"and an early version of the Mint Eye logo,"
707,it’s several pages…
JAEHEE,Oh my god…
707,And I found the blueprints for the Mint Eye headquarters that I’ve been looking into.
JAEHEE,What in the world…
JAEHEE,How are they there?
MC,Shouldn’t we ask V?
707,No.
707,Let’s not consider V as a possible option.
JAEHEE,Then who do we ask?
MC,We don’t know… We can only assume that Rika had a secret.
JAEHEE,"Rika…? No, that can’t be."
707,We don’t know…
707,but I’m sure that there’s something related to Mint Eye that we don’t know about.
707,"Considering the current situation,"
707,I think our only option is for me to take action and uncover the truth.
707,"I was going to head over to Mint Eye headquarters right away,"
707,but I plan to rummage through everything in this room before I go
JAEHEE,V said that everything in that room is classified information…
707,Yes.
707,I’m sure there’s some very important information here.
707,I’ll go to the Mint Eye headquarters after that.
JAEHEE,"MC is not going with you, is she?"
MC,"I’m scared, but I decided to go with him. T_T"
JAEHEE,Are you sure?
JAEHEE,Is there a reason MC has to go?
MC,I will.
JAEHEE,That’s a bit…
JAEHEE,I think MC should stay with us…
707,Saeran already knows everything about MC.
707,"He knows where we are, where we go…"
707,He’ll trace us without a miss.
707,Rather than hiding… she’ll be safer to go with me.
707,Since I’m the only one who can avoid Saeran’s eyes.
JAEHEE,Luciel…
JAEHEE,I’m getting quite scared.
JAEHEE,"So many truths have come out in such a short time, and you’re acting on your own… I’m worried something bad might happen."
JAEHEE,Why don’t we all go there together after the party?
MC,Seven’s already thought enough about this. Please trust him when he says it’s time to act.
707,It’s just as MC said.
707,What I’m about to do may seem very rash to you…
707,but I’m hurrying because I don’t have a good feeling about it.
MC,That’s a good idea too.
JAEHEE,"Considering the fact that you’re heading towards a dangerous place,"
JAEHEE,shouldn’t you prepare a proper strategy?
707,You have a point…
707,but I should move as soon as possible right now.
707,It’s suspicious that V only gave us a week to prepare for the party.
707,"When V discussed it with me, his voice was very excited."
707,I feel like… we should move before the party.
JAEHEE,Hmm…
JAEHEE,I don’t quite understand what that feeling is…
707,V knew that these materials were here.
707,"At this point, everything he did… feels like an excuse to hide something."
707,"Anyways, nothing will come out of"
707,us being suspicious.
707,so I plan to leave tomorrow at the latest.
JAEHEE,"If you say so, then I understand."
JAEHEE,"Please let me know if you need anything,"
707,Thank you.
707,I’ve realized a lot of things… thanks to MC.
707,I realized how important it is that the members are by my side.
MC,"I’m glad to hear you say that, Seven."
707,I feel so bad that I just kept hurting you.
707,Once this is over.
707,I want to make MC happy.
JAEHEE,^^
JAEHEE,You two look so good together.
JAEHEE,I’ve never seen MC’s face… but I have a hunch that she is very cute.
707,…She is cute.
MC,You do?
707,I’m not good at expressing my feelings…
707,"but thanks to you, it occurred to me that I could live a life that’s about more than just being a secret agent."
JAEHEE,I see that you two have gotten much closer.
JAEHEE,I hoped to see you two at the party…
JAEHEE,"but if you leave tomorrow, it’s likely that you will not attend."
707,Once we find out all the secrets… I’ll make it up to you all.
707,I think I should go.
707,I have a lot of work to do form now.
JAEHEE,"Alright, go ahead."
707,"MC, will you come to the kitchen? I need to pack some things and I need more hands."
MC,"Alright. Jaehee, I’ll get going too~"
JAEHEE,"Yes, good luck!"
707,We’ll come back later.
JAEHEE,I’ll be cheering for the both of you.
MC,We’re off!
JAEHEE,I hope you two are safe…
JAEHEE,I must go and pray.
YOOSUNG,What is this….
MC,"The materials in Rika’s drawer… It’s very shocking, isn’t it?"
MC,Yoosung…
YOOSUNG,MC….
YOOSUNG,There’s more shocking news….?
YOOSUNG,This is……
YOOSUNG,I can’t believe those things were in her drawer…!
YOOSUNG,This doesn’t make sense…
MC,I’m shocked too. It must be more so for you.
YOOSUNG,Please someone tell me this is a conspiracy.
MC,"Hello, Jumin."
JUMIN,"Hello, MC and Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,"Jumin,"
YOOSUNG,did you see them?
JUMIN,I did.
YOOSUNG,What in the world is this…?
YOOSUNG,There’s no way that Rika did this!
YOOSUNG,Something’s wrong!
JUMIN,"First, calm down."
YOOSUNG,How can I!?
JUMIN,"Luciel is on it, and V’s coming back for the party…"
JUMIN,All the secrets will be revealed soon.
YOOSUNG,I doubt it.
YOOSUNG,I wish this were a dream…
MC,"But… it was Rika who requested for the bomb, and the materials were found in her apartment…"
YOOSUNG,…
YOOSUNG,She’d never do something like that.
YOOSUNG,The truth will be different…
JUMIN,Calm down…
JUMIN,MC is right according to everything we’ve found out so far.
YOOSUNG,What the hell is the truth!?
YOOSUNG,The Rika I knew
JUMIN,I know.
JUMIN,I know that Rika would never do something like that…
YOOSUNG,I’m sure there’s a reason.
YOOSUNG,I mean…
YOOSUNG,Oh!
YOOSUNG,Maybe those bad hackers forced Rika to draw them?
MC,"I don’t know… But even so, it looks as if she was a crucial part in building that organization."
YOOSUNG,MC;;;
YOOSUNG,Rika just got involved somehow…
YOOSUNG,She was framed!
YOOSUNG,There’s no way Rika got involved with a bad organization on purpose!
JUMIN,Yes… that’s a good theory.
YOOSUNG,"I… until we find out the truth,"
YOOSUNG,I don’t think I can sleep.
YOOSUNG,What do I do…?
MC,Calm yourself down first… we don’t know what went on yet.
JUMIN,Try to calm yourself down.
YOOSUNG,"Jumin,"
YOOSUNG,that’s not easy as you say…
MC,"If you’re that nervous, trying gaming."
YOOSUNG,I can’t do anything like this…
YOOSUNG,I don’t even know if I’m breathing right now…
JUMIN,Nothing will come out of being confused.
JUMIN,"I know it’s difficult… but don’t use your energy expressing your emotions, and save it."
YOOSUNG,I hope Seven asks for me to help…
YOOSUNG,Now that Rika is involved… he’s basically looking into my business.
JUMIN,"When Luciel decides that it’s not dangerous, I’m sure he will ask for help."
YOOSUNG,Right…?
JUMIN,"Yes, trust Luciel."
YOOSUNG,Alright…
YOOSUNG,"Then, I’ll go try and calm down…"
YOOSUNG,I should think about it.
YOOSUNG,I’ll try to think about what happened… remember how she was.
MC,"Yes, that’ll be better than this. Go ahead."
YOOSUNG,"Okay, I’ll come back as soon as I think of anything."
YOOSUNG,"Thanks, Jumin."
JUMIN,I’ll try to think what I can do to help as well.
YOOSUNG,Then I’ll get going.
MC,That’s a good idea…!
JUMIN,Let me know if you come up with anything.
YOOSUNG,Alright…
YOOSUNG,I’ll get going.
YOOSUNG,Thank you…
JUMIN,Ya.
JUMIN,I doubt…
JUMIN,I’ll fall asleep easily as well.
MC,"I’m sure you’re very surprised too, Jumin."
JUMIN,The things I’ve seen and heard today…
JUMIN,were definitely what the Rika I knew would have done.
JUMIN,Rika… V…
JUMIN,What in the world happened?
JUMIN,The truth won’t come out by me predicting… but I can’t help it.
JUMIN,I should drink a glass of wine and try to go to bed.
JUMIN,Since there’s only a day left until the party.
JUMIN,I must get going.
MC,"Feel better, Jumin."
JUMIN,"Yes, you too, MC."
JUMIN,"you’re with an important person right now, so your role is crucial."
JUMIN,Then I’ll get going.
MC,I’d like a glass of wine too.
JUMIN,Later if we have a chance…
JUMIN,"but toda, I’ll have to drink by myself."
JUMIN,Then good bye.
Mother,"Both of you! Don’t even dream about going outside. Don’t escape my sight. Or else, the scary daddy will come and get you. Don’t follow any strangers, okay? No kindergarten, just stay home."
Mother,"You boys are my children, not your father’s. Mine! You can only live here. This is our world!"
Mother,"Saeyoung! What did I tell you? I told you to keep an eye on the rope I tied Saeran with. Why is he wandering around in the kitchen? Do you want to be tied up this time? Saeran, come here! I’m going to tie you up again."
Saeran,Saeyoung… Save me.
Mother,Saeran… did you try to run away? Or did Saeran let you loose again? Tell me the truth! Or I’ll scold you!
Mother,"If you leave this place… your dad will kidnap you. You think he’ll leave you boys alone? He’ll kill you. He’ll kill you and bury your bodies so that no one can find them! So if you don’t want to die, stay here."
707,…Arrgh! God… I-it was a dream…
MC,"Seven, are you okay?"
707,Oh… did I surprise you? It’s nothing.
707,I just had a dream…
707,I’m fine… I must have been tired.
MC,Did you have a nightmare?
707,"Yes, something I didn’t want to remember…"
707,Just bad memories coming up again.
707,I should pull myself together now… I have to go save Saeran.
707,…I’m so glad that you’re by my side.
707,Thank you…
Mother,"Both of you! Don’t even dream about going outside. Don’t escape my sight. Or else, the scary daddy will come and get you. Don’t follow any strangers, okay? No kindergarten, just stay home."
Mother,"You boys are my children, not your father’s. Mine! You can only live here. This is our world!"
Mother,"Saeyoung! What did I tell you? I told you to keep an eye on the rope I tied Saeran with. Why is he wandering around in the kitchen? Do you want to be tied up this time? Saeran, come here! I’m going to tie you up again."
Saeran,Saeyoung… Save me.
Mother,Saeran… did you try to run away? Or did Saeran let you loose again? Tell me the truth! Or I’ll scold you!
Mother,"If you leave this place… your dad will kidnap you. You think he’ll leave you boys alone? He’ll kill you. He’ll kill you and bury your bodies so that no one can find them! So if you don’t want to die, stay here."
707,…Arrgh! God… I-it was a dream…
MC,"Seven, are you okay?"
707,Oh… did I surprise you? It’s nothing.
707,I just had a dream…
707,I’m fine… I must have been tired.
MC,Did you have a nightmare?
707,"Yes, something I didn’t want to remember…"
707,Just bad memories coming up again.
707,I should pull myself together now… I have to go save Saeran.
707,…I’m so glad that you’re by my side.
707,Thank you…
MC,I can’t sleep…
ZEN,Me neither.
ZEN,I came here because I started having bad dreams but…
MC,"Zen, you can’t sleep either, right?"
ZEN,Not at all.
ZEN,I started having bad dreams and all these thoughts just took over me.
ZEN,I came here to take a breather…
ZEN,It’s worse here?? ;;;
ZEN,"I mean, the party’s tomorrow…"
ZEN,All these shocking news
ZEN,is getting way over my head.
ZEN,Rika kept materials related to Mint Eye at her apartment?
ZEN,HOW THE HELL DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?!
MC,"I honestly don’t know about Rika, but I’m worried about Yoosung. He seems really shocked."
ZEN,Yeah;; He practically worshipped her;;;
ZEN,I don’t know how to treat V anymore…
ZEN,To be honest…
ZEN,I’m appalled that Rika kept those things at that drawer
ZEN,but I’m more disappointed in the fact that V lied about it…;;
MC,We do know for sure now that V lied about that drawer.
ZEN,God…
ZEN,No doubt about that…
ZEN,I was super vocal about it…
ZEN,but I still trusted V despite all the suspicious…;;
ZEN,I really thought that maybe there’re just love letters in there.
ZEN,But….
ZEN,Now it’s a fact that he was hiding it…
ZEN,I don’t know what to think.
ZEN,I really believed that V suddenly left because he lost service…
ZEN,but now I can’t even believe that anymore.
ZEN,"Until this trust issue with V gets solved,"
ZEN,I don’t think I can focus on acting.
ZEN,"Rika, V, Seven’s brother, and Mint Eye."
ZEN,My head is about to explode thinking about all that T_T
MC,I feel so complicated too. I had no idea that RFA had so many secrets.
ZEN,Exactly!!
ZEN,"You decided to help because of the charity party,"
ZEN,but now you’re in a middle of a huge storm;;
ZEN,We weren’t always like this… I’m so sorry you have to go through this.
ZEN,God…
ZEN,Looks like I’ll be staying up all night.
ZEN,I should go clear my head.
ZEN,"I’m afraid of getting any news now,"
ZEN,but still…
ZEN,tell Seven to let us know if he finds something…;
MC,I will. Don’t worry too much and try to get some rest.
ZEN,Thanks.
ZEN,I’m sorry for complaining when it must be harder for you.
ZEN,Being disappointed in someone I’ve known for a long time
ZEN,just kind of shakes up my past.
ZEN,You get some rest too.
ZEN,I’ll get going.
MC,Perhaps ignorance is bliss for dark secrets.
ZEN,"I kind of agree,"
ZEN,"but now that the secret’s come out, we can’t just ignore it…"
ZEN,I don’t think I’ll feel better until everything becomes certain T_T
ZEN,I’ll get going.
ZEN,I should go stretch
ZEN,or get some fresh air.
ZEN,See you later.
MC,"Yoosung… You can’t sleep, right?"
YOOSUNG,Major fail on mission go to bed.
YOOSUNG,I stayed up all night
YOOSUNG,thinking this and that.
YOOSUNG,"No matter how much I think, I’m certain that Rika was just used."
YOOSUNG,I‘m sure that evil organization Mint Eye just threatened Rika.
MC,I don’t know a lot about her.. but I think that’s possible.
YOOSUNG,I’m sure that those people
YOOSUNG,threatened her and forced her to create those documents
YOOSUNG,and help them…
YOOSUNG,Rika…
YOOSUNG,"In the end, Rika might have…"
YOOSUNG,killed herself
YOOSUNG,because she couldn’t stand that pressure.
YOOSUNG,"So… I’m desperate,"
YOOSUNG,I’m desperate to find the truth.
YOOSUNG,Isn’t Seven saying anything? He’s still rummaging through the apartment?
MC,Hmm… I think he’s doing something.
YOOSUNG,I’m sure he’s doing the best he can.
YOOSUNG,"I understand that he has a lot on his shoulders right now,"
YOOSUNG,but I desperately hope that she clears her name.
MC,Yes… He’s checking every corner.
YOOSUNG,I want to believe that Seven will definitely find the truth.
YOOSUNG,"Please, whatever it is,"
YOOSUNG,I want him to find something.
YOOSUNG,The truth V’s hiding…
YOOSUNG,I want to know…
707,Yoosung…
YOOSUNG,Seven!
707,Look at the time.
707,It didn’t even occur to me to go to bed.
MC,I couldn’t fall asleep either thinking about what was in Rika’s drawer.
707,I see.
YOOSUNG,"Seven, did you find anything?"
YOOSUNG,Didn’t you find any evidence of Rika being blackmailed or anything?
YOOSUNG,"If you find something like that, tell me!"
MC,I couldn’t fall asleep because you were rummaging through every corner of the apartment.
707,"Oh, I’m sorry…"
707,I was so focused that I didn’t realize I was making a noise.
707,"I’m pretty much done, so I won’t be so loud anymore."
YOOSUNG,Did you find anything?
YOOSUNG,If you did then tell me!!!
707,First calm down…
707,and just listen to me.
YOOSUNG,Okay.
707,What I found
707,was mostly personal information of previous party guests.
707,But…
YOOSUNG,But?
707,I found Rika’s agenda… and I couldn’t ignore it.
YOOSUNG,What did you find?
707,Each category was either labelled RFA or ME…
YOOSUNG,RFA… ME
707,And she had something to do with ME at least three times a week.
MC,Perhaps it was quality time for herself?
YOOSUNG,You can see it that way!
707,I’d like to say that you’re right…
707,but I don’t think so.
MC,ME…. Mint Eye?
YOOSUNG,Can we be so sure of that…?
YOOSUNG,It might be something else.
707,I think MC is right.
707,The meeting place for everything labeled ME…
707,matches the address of Mint Eye’s headquarters.
YOOSUNG,···
YOOSUNG,Then I guess it’s certain.
707,"The ME label… is all over this year’s agenda, from beginning to end."
707,The last date in the agenda is the day she left this apartment because of the special security system.
707,A couple months before she died…
YOOSUNG,….
707,I think she left this agenda here as she left.
707,Voluntarily or not… we know for sure that she was involved in this organization for more than a year.
YOOSUNG,Rika…
YOOSUNG,It must have been so hard for her…
YOOSUNG,She kept this a secret from us all along…
YOOSUNG,I’m sure that I’m right.
YOOSUNG,She was being threatened by that organization.
YOOSUNG,For over a year…!
YOOSUNG,Maybe she was suffering… for a very long time…
MC,Then… Mint Eye may have been exploiting Saeran too…
YOOSUNG,Oh…
707,Maybe.
707,Maybe Saeran was too…
YOOSUNG,Yeah!
MC,"You don’t think that V found Mint Eye, do you? haha"
707,"If that’s true, it would be very shocking…"
YOOSUNG,It wouldn’t be weird at this point if that turns out to be true.
YOOSUNG,He never really explained to us about Rika’s death!
YOOSUNG,Mint Eye might be using your brother Saeran too…
707,…
YOOSUNG,Seven…
YOOSUNG,Rika’s no longer with us
YOOSUNG,but the same thing can’t happen to your brother…
YOOSUNG,"You understand what I mean, right?"
707,Yeah…
707,I will never let that happen.
707,Saeran’s already had a sad enough life…
MC,We might not be able to do anything if he’s been brainwashed.
YOOSUNG,No way…!!
707,…
YOOSUNG,I’m sure that hasn’t happened to him!!
707,Right…?
MC,"I’ll be with you until the truth is revealed, Seven."
707,"I will not take that lightly, MC…"
707,"I will do everything I can do uncover the truth,"
707,and get my brother back.
YOOSUNG,Seven…
YOOSUNG,Make sure to find the truth.
YOOSUNG,If she really had to leave this world
YOOSUNG,"because she was being threatened,"
YOOSUNG,I really won’t stay put.
707,I’ll make sure to find the truth.
YOOSUNG,I’m sure that you’ll be able to…
MC,When will we leave for Mint Eye?
707,"Since I don’t think this room holds any more secret,"
707,it’s dawn…
707,but I think we should get ready to leave soon.
MC,Aren’t you putting too much pressure on Seven?
707,No… I don’t feel pressured at all.
707,I actually think that it’s my mission to find the truth.
YOOSUNG,Seven…
707,I think we should get going.
YOOSUNG,To Mint Eye?
707,Yes. MC… let’s get ready.
YOOSUNG,Alright!
YOOSUNG,I’ll be waiting!
MC,"We’ll have to miss the party, but we’ll definitely find the truth."
YOOSUNG,Yup!
YOOSUNG,My heart’s with you both!
707,Thank you.
MC,"Please take good care of the party even if we’re not there, Yoosung."
YOOSUNG,Yup. I think Jumin’s putting in a lot of effort.
YOOSUNG,"We’ll make sure your efforts are put in vain, so don’t worry and be careful! bd"
YOOSUNG,"Oh,"
YOOSUNG,why don’t you leave the address of the place you’re going.
YOOSUNG,That way maybe Jumin can help if you guys are in danger.
YOOSUNG,He can send body guards… or call the police!
707,"I thought about that,"
707,and it’s not a bad idea… but the information might leak.
707,I only want the least number of people to know for now.
MC,"I’ll trust your decision, Seven."
YOOSUNG,I’m worried…
YOOSUNG,but alright if that’s what you think is best.
707,Thanks to you both.
YOOSUNG,"But tell me when you need help, okay."
707,Yup.
MC,Several people are involved already. Should we just tell everyone?
707,"I respect your opinion,"
707,"but I just feel… that if we go large scale on this, Saeran will be in danger."
YOOSUNG,I get what you mean.
YOOSUNG,I’ll just trust you and wait.
707,"Okay, thanks."
707,"Regarding the information I find,"
707,I’ll sign in as often as I can to update everyone
707,so make sure to check whenever you can.
YOOSUNG,Alright!
YOOSUNG,MC…
YOOSUNG,Seven will protect you but please be careful…!
YOOSUNG,Seven!
YOOSUNG,"If,"
YOOSUNG,"just in case, if!"
YOOSUNG,Things don’t work out with Saeran…
YOOSUNG,please remember that we are your family too.
707,Okay…
707,You know MC’s in the RFA family right?
YOOSUNG,Of course!
707,"Then wish her luck, more than for me."
707,"MC, I’ll get ready first."
MC,"Okay, make sure to grab your jacket so you’re not cold ^^"
707,I will…^^
YOOSUNG,Seven and MC’s
YOOSUNG,grand journey to find the truth!!!!
YOOSUNG,I’m sure it’ll be a happy ending”
707,"Thanks, Yoosung."
707,Then I’ll be off!
MC,I’ll start getting ready too.
707,"Okay, come out to the living room when you’re ready ^^"
YOOSUNG,Good luck to both of you…
707,Thanks… I’ll be off now.
YOOSUNG,MC…
YOOSUNG,"You have to come back safe, alright?"
YOOSUNG,"Seven, MC,"
YOOSUNG,everyone should come back safe
YOOSUNG,and I hope we find out the truth about Rika.
YOOSUNG,All my prayers are with you both.
MC,I doubt prayers work… but thank you anyways.
YOOSUNG,I’m sorry that’s all I can do…
YOOSUNG,but thank you for saying thank you!!
YOOSUNG,Bye!
MC,Thank you. I’ll go get ready now.^^
YOOSUNG,Don’t mind me and go ahead.
YOOSUNG,I’ll be praying!
YOOSUNG,Come back safe!
707,MC… I’m sorry if I sound like I’m doubting you.
707,But… this will be a dangerous journey. Are you really… ready?
MC,"For now, following you will be my safest option."
707,Yes… You know very well.
MC,I can go anywhere if you’re there with me. That won’t change.
707,Thank you. I really… wanted to hear that one more time.
707,"We’ll be on the road for a long time. if you’re tired, you can sleep on the passenger seat."
707,MC…
707,"I’ve already said this multiple time, but I’ll make sure to protect you no matter what happens."
707,Even if it costs me my life… I swear.
707,In that sense… this… you should have this now.
MC,What am I supposed to do with this?
707,Please just consider it as a friend. The robot’s programmed to be like 707 in the messenger.
707,This one cannot understand the emotion sadness. So… it will cheer you up.
707,If something happens to me… I’d feel much better if I know that this cat will comfort you.
MC,Wow! The robot cat! You… fixed it?
707,Yes… I originally intended to give it to you. I’m sorry I broke it.
707,The cat’s programmed to be like 707.
707,The 707 that jokes around all the time and is always bright.
707,If something happens to me… I hope this robot comforts you a bit.
707,I… I’ve never given someone such a caring gift before.
707,"I always thought of myself as someone who should be forgotten, so I thought it was pointless to give someone something to remember me by."
707,"But… Here I am, in front of you, now such a different person."
707,"I stand here, hoping to be never forgotten by you."
707,"I don’t deserve to give you a gift… but if there is a God, I hope he listens, I hope he lets me be a bit selfish."
707,I hope he lets us return safe from this journey… so that I can give you many more gifts in the future…
MC,I don’t want to leave my future up to a God that might not even exist. Can’t we just focus more on reality?
707,I’m sorry. I got a bit too emotional there.
MC,"Yes, let’s go find the truth and come back safe."
707,The happiness of having a relationship with someone forever…
707,The hope of meeting a new future with someone… I thought this was a dream I could never achieve as 707.
707,You’ve brought out the new me.
707,I’ll never forget that.
707,I’ll do my best at life. ‘ll protect you with everything I have.
707,Regardless of what truth is waiting for me… I’ll try my best to be calm.
RoboCat,Time to leave meow! Leave meow!
707,Oh… there goes the alarm. I set it just before. I’ll tell you how this robot operates as we go.
707,Did you get all your stuff? Give me things that are heavy.
707,Let’s go now.
MC,"I’m a bit scared, but please do your best."
707,Trust me.
707,Shall we go?
MC,"Yes, let’s go together!"
707,"Yes, together…!"
JAEHEE,"MC, hello."
JAEHEE,Did you guys leave?
MC,"Jumin, is work going well?"
JUMIN,Ya.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han;; I didn’t realize you’re here;
MC,"Yes, we’re on our way."
JAEHEE,I’m glad.
JAEHEE,I hope you get there safe.
JUMIN,"I suppose you came here as soon as I went into the office, Assistant Kang."
JUMIN,You seemed very busy this morning.
JAEHEE,"I think it’s the same for you, Mr. Han…"
JAEHEE,"But MR. Han,"
JAEHEE,"you did ask for triple espresso shots, so I did make it,"
JAEHEE,but are you really fine with that?
JUMIN,"Yes, that’s fine. I feel like I need a strong blend today."
MC,"Jumin, you didn’t sleep very well last night?"
JUMIN,I doubt anyone had a good sleep last night
JAEHEE,Yes… I didn’t as well…
MC,"Jaehee, you have to worry about RFA, your boss… it must be difficult."
JAEHEE,I’m fine.
JAEHEE,"Compared to the trouble you’re going through, this isn’t anything."
JUMIN,I suppose you didn’t sleep well last night either.
JAEHEE,"No, I didn’t…"
JUMIN,Everyone’s suffering through a mental breakdown because of what was found in Rika’s drawer.
JAEHEE,"Well, a mental breakdown…;;;"
JUMIN,"I’m not worried about Zen since he’ll feel better after taking a couple selfies,"
JUMIN,but I’m worried about everyone else.
JAEHEE,I apologize for saying this
JAEHEE,but I think you’re wrong about that.
JUMIN,?
JAEHEE,"As a great actor, Zen is a very emotional person."
JAEHEE,Everything that’s been happening may be damaging Zen’s emotions and giving him enormous pain.
MC,"Jaehee, did you watch Zen’s DVD last night because you couldn’t sleep?"
JAEHEE,How did you know?
JUMIN,It’s very obvious.
JAEHEE,I felt like I couldn’t sleep before seeing it.
JUMIN,"It sounds like a petty excuse, but I understand."
JAEHEE,-_-
JUMIN,I couldn’t sleep either so I counted how many strands of hair Elizabeth loses per second.
JUMIN,I also found the average length… I’m glad I had a micro ruler I got from the owner of Office Depop.
MC,How long was it on average?
JUMIN,"Her inside hair was 2.10485 on average, and our outside fur was about 3.71572cm."
JUMIN,I rounded it up on the sixth decimal point.
JAEHEE,That’s amazing.
JUMIN,But the length slightly differed according to the color.
JUMIN,"If I can collect enough samples to prove that the hair length differs according to the color,"
JUMIN,I can hold a conference on it.
JAEHEE,…Do you mean Conference on the Length Difference of Cat Fur According to Color?
JUMIN,"No, that’s too objective."
JUMIN,"How about Black Cat, White Cat, the Mysterious World of Fur?"
JAEHEE,"I apologize,"
JAEHEE,but can we go back to the story of ‘MC and Seven’s life risking journey to discover the truth’?
MC,Do you think the length has to do with the owner’s affection levels?
JUMIN,Hmm… I think there must be a relation.
JAEHEE,Let’s
JAEHEE,change
JAEHEE,the subject.
JUMIN,Alright.
JUMIN,"There was something I wanted to ask you, MC."
MC,···
JAEHEE,"Anyways,"
JAEHEE,"I’m a bit surprised that you’re here as usual, MC."
JUMIN,"It means she’s safe, so it’s good."
JUMIN,I’m curious how you feel.
JUMIN,You’re heading to a place you know nothing about with Luciel without any outside help…
JUMIN,Aren’t you scared?
MC,Nothing will come out of being scared. i have to be calm.
JUMIN,I like what you said.
MC,"I’m not, since I’m with someone I trust."
JAEHEE,You both have such a beautiful trusting relationship.
JUMIN,Like me and Assistant Kang.
JAEHEE,Excuse me?
JUMIN,It’s a joke.
JUMIN,I thought it would be funny.
JAEHEE,"Thank you, hahaha."
JUMIN,But you know..
JUMIN,if you leave…
JUMIN,who will greet the guests?
JAEHEE,I’m sorry?
MC,"Haha, just please take care of it."
JUMIN,Weren’t you the one who talked to all the guests?
JUMIN,They will be disappointed not to see you there.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han.
JUMIN,?
MC,"Jumin, why are you so obsessed with the party?"
JUMIN,Why do you say that?
JAEHEE,Because it truly seems like you are obsessed.
JUMIN,No way.
JUMIN,The word obsession does not exist in my dictionary.
JUMIN,I only wish to keep our promise.
JAEHEE,"I’ve worked with you long enough to understand that you are simply doing your work,"
JAEHEE,but if others see this right now…
JAEHEE,they will say that all your neurons that send emotions are damaged.
JUMIN,So I’ll just have to think that MC and Luciel will not return before the party.
MC,I guess I won’t have to worry about the party now ^^
JUMIN,"I rarely fail, so you can trust me."
JAEHEE,We will do our best to take care of everything
JAEHEE,so that your efforts are not turned to vain.
MC,"Good luck, Jaehee."
JAEHEE,^^ Thank you.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han…
JAEHEE,I will make sure to take care of the party in between work.
JAEHEE,So please do not give the two on a rough journey any more pressure and cheer them up instead.
JUMIN,I have no plans to pressure them.
JUMIN,I have my priorities straight.
JUMIN,"First, we’ll have to prepare everything under the assumption that they will not attend."
JUMIN,"As members of the RFA, making the party a success is what we can do."
JAEHEE,Yes…. you’re right.
MC,I’ll just think about taking care of this and coming back safe.
JAEHEE,Of course.
JAEHEE,Just leave everything to us.
MC,"Thank you… We won’t be able to attend, but please take good care of it."
JUMIN,We’re only doing what we have to do
JUMIN,Oh.
JUMIN,Perhaps Zen should greet the guests then…
JAEHEE,Should we write a script or something…?
JUMIN,That may be best.
JAEHEE,Then I’ll have to start right now as we don’t have much time.
JAEHEE,"MC, please be safe."
MC,"Okay, thank you. Good luck!"
JAEHEE,Then I’ll get going.
JUMIN,Yup.
MC,Seven promised that he’d protect me. Don’t worry!
JAEHEE,I will be praying for you two.
JAEHEE,Good bye…
JUMIN,"This party is happening all because of you,"
JUMIN,but it’s a pity that you won’t be there.
MC,Let Elizabeth go instead of me.
JUMIN,…
JUMIN,I will seriously consider it.
MC,"Do you want to me, is that it? ^^"
JUMIN,I would be lying if I said I don’t want to see the person who’s let us have the party again.
JUMIN,Many things have happened… but I wanted to thank you for joining RFA and doing so much for us.
JUMIN,I know very well that it is more important for you two to return safely rather than the party.
JUMIN,In that sense…
JUMIN,Will you tell Luciel something?
MC,"Yes, go ahead."
JUMIN,"I’m making sure that everyone is well protected,"
JUMIN,so he shouldn’t worry about us
JUMIN,and come back safely after finding the truth.
MC,What is it?
JUMIN,"I’ll be making sure that everyone is safe,"
JUMIN,so he should finish what he has to and come back safely.
MC,I’ll tell him if I get the chance.
JUMIN,Alright.
MC,I’ll let him know.
JUMIN,Thank you.
JUMIN,Then…
JUMIN,I should go prepare the party now.
JUMIN,Please let us know when you get there.
MC,"Okay, good bye."
JUMIN,I’ll be off.
MC,I don’t know when that will be but alright.
JUMIN,"I hope next time we talk to each other, there’s good news."
JUMIN,Then good bye.
YOOSUNG,MC!
YOOSUNG,Are you there yet?
MC,We’re still on the road. It’s far…
YOOSUNG,You both must be tired…
MC,Not yet. I’m worried he’s speeding right now.
YOOSUNG,"I understand that he wants to get there asap,"
YOOSUNG,but speeding is dangerous
YOOSUNG,so please watch over him!
YOOSUNG,Zen
ZEN,MC!!
ZEN,Are you okay!?
ZEN,There weren’t any ugly bandits trying to steal Seven’s car!?
YOOSUNG,What? NO way.
MC,…Is this the time for jokes?
ZEN,"…Hmm, wrong timing?"
YOOSUNG,Zen… Don’t.
ZEN,Sorry…
MC,Well… I think we saw flying squirrels that looked like dessert cats lol
YOOSUNG,lolololololol
YOOSUNG,No way that’s true lolol
ZEN,lololololol
ZEN,You’re still funny.
ZEN,But
ZEN,Yoosung;
ZEN,Are you okay?
ZEN,Did you go to school?
YOOSUNG,I really can’t get myself to go to school today.
YOOSUNG,I’m taking a break since the party’s tomorrow.
MC,"Yes, you must still be in shock. Rest up."
ZEN,I plan to miss practice today too.
YOOSUNG,T_T
YOOSUNG,I understand.
ZEN,"I wanted to take a break,"
ZEN,but Jaehee sent over the guest list today.
ZEN,She wanted me to go greet them instead of you.
MC,I’m sorry I can’t go. Please take care of the party for me. ^^
ZEN,No need to be sorry…! Don’t say that.
ZEN,"I don’t have a lot of energy right now,"
ZEN,but I’m glad that there’s something
ZEN,I can do right now.
MC,I should be the one to do it… Shame.
ZEN,I’ll try to pull myself together first…
ZEN,and do my best for you.
ZEN,"It’s sad that I can’t see you tomorrow,"
ZEN,but this isn’t the time to say that right now I guess;
YOOSUNG,"If we think about Rika,"
YOOSUNG,we have to have the party tomorrow no matter what…
YOOSUNG,but
YOOSUNG,I’m also afraid that we might find more shocking truth.
ZEN,I’m worried about that too…
ZEN,And for their safety…
ZEN,I hope everything works out
ZEN,and we can all smile soon.
MC,That day will come… trust us.
YOOSUNG,Okay!! I’ll try to cheer up!!
ZEN,"God,"
ZEN,Seven gave me so much help.
ZEN,I feel so bad that all I can do is cheer for him.
MC,Well… we’ll have to see the results.
YOOSUNG,I’m afraid of the results T_T
ZEN,T_T
YOOSUNG,Tomorrow’s supposed to be a good day…
YOOSUNG,but I’m worried something else will happen once V comes back T_T
ZEN,No way…;;
ZEN,Let’s first try to calm ourselves down.
ZEN,"Just like what Jaehee said before,"
ZEN,us doing what we can in our places
ZEN,is what helps Seven.
YOOSUNG,That’s true but…
MC,"I understand that you’re nervous, but please have more faith in Seven."
YOOSUNG,I do trust him!
YOOSUNG,I think it’s just my problem…
YOOSUNG,Thinking that Rika’s involved in all this..
YOOSUNG,I can’t calm down.
MC,Call your mother. You might feel better once you talk to her.
YOOSUNG,Should I…?
YOOSUNG,I won’t be able to tell her what’s going on… but hearing her voice might make me feel better.
ZEN,Go ahead.
ZEN,Let’s do whatever we can.
ZEN,We should both take care of ourselves.
ZEN,The party’s not our top priority
ZEN,but two of the members can’t make it.
ZEN,We should at least try to cheer up!
YOOSUNG,"You’re right, Zen T_T"
YOOSUNG,I should go wash my face and try to calm down again.
ZEN,That’s a good idea.
ZEN,don’t skip your meals even if you skipp school.
YOOSUNG,"Okay, thanks."
MC,Cheer up~!
YOOSUNG,I’ll try to come back as super bright and positive Yoosung
YOOSUNG,to fill Seven’s place!
YOOSUNG,I’ll get going.
MC,Bye.
YOOSUNG,"Okay, be careful!"
YOOSUNG,I’ll be back soon!
ZEN,God…
ZEN,"The party’s tomorrow, but it’s like we’re having a funeral."
MC,Lead the way and have everyone cheer up Zen!
ZEN,"I’m trying, haha."
ZEN,Today might be gloomy…
ZEN,but tomorrow I’ll cheer up and complete the mission Jaehee gave me!
MC,Don’t just worry and do something that’s helpful.
ZEN,Something that’s helpful…
ZEN,"Yes, I should read the list Jaehee gave me."
ZEN,I have to help…
ZEN,MC… will you please let us know if something happens?
MC,"Alright Zen, good luck."
ZEN,"Okay, you just focus on what you’re doing with Seven."
ZEN,Then see you later.
ZEN,Be careful!
MC,"Okay, I will."
ZEN,Thank you.
ZEN,I’ll trust you and go now.
ZEN,See you later…
Vanderwood,"I’ve finished everything he’s left behind, so I should try tracking him asap…"
Vanderwood,Agent 707’s car’s been moving from this morning.
Vanderwood,Where is he going so fast…?
Vanderwood,I should leave now and chase him… I’ll borrow one of his cars.
Vanderwood,"I’ve once respected you as a genius… I’m sad this is how it’s going to be, Agent 707."
Vanderwood,I’ll see you soon.
707,We’ve been in the car all along. Aren’t you uncomfortable?
MC,I’m fine. Are we here?
707,Yes… it was a long ride.
707,Do you see that building in front of us.
707,All the secrets will be there.
707,You should prepare yourself right now.
MC,It was a bit uncomfortable.
707,I’m sorry… I should have come faster.
707,You’ll be able to rest just after this.
707,Can you please concentrate right now though?
707,"MC, listen carefully."
707,I’m going to aim to get as much information as I can from this place.
707,"So before we go in, we have to figure out how this building works."
707,"First, I’m going to disrupt the building security system for about five minutes."
707,And then I’ll infiltrate… Look at this.
707,"The green part here is the view parameters of the security cameras. The parts in red are alarm devices. As soon as the security system is down, we’ll enter through the blue route here."
707,"Once we get in, this is the building layout. Our first goal is to go that circled part over there."
707,I found that most data transfers were coming from that location. I don’t know what the inside is like… but it’s probably going to be the information room.
707,I plan to go in there and hack into the computer myself. And about Saeran… I plan to find the safest way to find him once I analyze the information I acquire.
707,but we might run into him. And if that happens… I’ll just have to pray to God to make everything work.
707,"Don’t ever leave my side, alright?"
MC,I won’t…! Let’s do this and go back home!
707,"With that encouragement, I know we can do this."
707,"I’ll make sure to be wide awake, so you just follow me right behind, alright?"
MC,"Okay, we’ll just have to hope for the best."
707,We can make that hope come true.
707,I want to be with you in a world where bad things will no longer happen…
707,I’ll start hacking into the security system.
707,I came to update everyone but no one’s here;
MC,"Yeah, I guess everyone’s busy because of the party."
707,"Yeah, it’s tomorrow…"
707,"Still, I’ll have to give the update!"
707,We got here safely!
707,Come here for a sec…
707,Ahem >.<
MC,We look like a cute couple.
707,We thought the same thing…^^
707,All the members here!
707,I’m hacking right now lol
707,I’m almost finished hacking into the building security system…
707,"so once the system’s down, MC and I will go in."
707,We’re going to what we think is the information room.
707,"I’m going to acquire as much information as I can, analyze it and decide what to do."
707,Of course…
707,this is just a plan..
MC,I don’t think we’ll run into any enemies if we just follow your plan.
707,Thanks for trusting me ^^
707,"I’ll take care of it as fast as I can, and as safely as I can, so have hope."
MC,It might all be game over if we meet Saeran or run into security…
707,"Unlike a game, we won’t be able to restart though…"
707,If someone finds us… I’ll make sure that at least MC runs away.
707,So trust me on that!
707,But…
707,I feel a bit strange.
707,"This won’t be the last,"
707,"but coming to the messenger,"
707,I can’t help but think that
707,this might be the last thing I say here…
707,I shouldn’t have MC see me like this ^^;;
MC,Don’t think that. We’ll come back safe!
707,Yes… We will.
707,"Still, I’d like to say this."
MC,I feel more scared hearing you say that…
707,I didn’t mean to scare you… I’m sorry!
707,I got a bit nervous back there but I’ll put myself together.
707,I’ve said thanks to MC multiple times already…
707,but I’m sincerely grateful to everyone in the RFA.
707,"I had to meet everyone while hiding who I am,"
707,but everyone trusted me and was kind.
707,I was happy to talk to everyone as the bright and quirky 707
707,but on one hand…
707,I felt sad that I had to leave soon.
707,Thinking that the members and MC will forget me one day
707,really got to me… although I never showed it.
707,707 was always ‘temporary’…
707,and Luciel was a ‘secret agent’…
707,"Byt from now on,"
707,everyone will see the real me.
707,"Especially, MC."
707,MC…
707,Do you want to know my real name?
MC,Is there a reason you want to tell me here?
707,Because I want all the members to know too.
MC,Then tell me.
707,My real name is
MC,"Yes, please let everyone know here."
707,My real name is
707,Saeyoung…
707,Saeyoung Choi
707,"I’m not a weirdo, a hacker… I’m just Saeyoung who grew up in a bad place… and had to wear the mask of 707..!"
707,"Once this is over,"
707,"I’m going to get rid of that name,"
707,"quit working as an agent as Luciel,"
707,and go back to living as Saeyoung.
707,Do you think… I can really do that?
MC,Let’s talk after we’re finished with this. Let’s get going.
707,Alright.
MC,Of course.
707,I’m so happy to hear that.
707,Okay. Let’s cheer up and do this!
707,Shall we go in now?
707,Once everyone sees this…
707,wish us all the luck!
707,MC… watch out for footsteps.
707,I don’t think anyone knows we’re here yet.
707,"This is the room where most data transfers happen. I’m going to hack into the lock system, so please just wait a bit."
Laptop,Analyzing the code…
Laptop,Found the code. CY21MK#20LJ142… Complete.
707,… This is.
707,I knew it. This is where the server is…
MC,Do you think Saeran hacked into our system here?
707,That’s very likely.
707,This computer probably hacked into my algorithm… Look at this keyboard. The coating’s almost off. Someone’s been typing for a very long time here.
MC,The computer looks really nice…
707,It’s a bit old but I can see that it’s been consistently upgraded.
707,A couple keys are more worn than others. This doesn’t really happen with keyboards that a lot of people use…
707,Maybe Saeran hacked into our system here.
707,God.. Where in the world did he learn how to hack…? Why did he have to learn this… I want to know.
MC,"First… if Saeran really used this computer, we’d better start transferring the materials."
707,"Oh, right. I’m sorry."
707,"The toggle that I brought… Here it is. First, plug it into the one that looks most important… then password… I knew it."
MC,It’s no use wondering about it now.
707,Of course.
707,Let’s just get this over with and get out of here.
707,"Connect the cable attached to my laptop, open password macro… RK184JP okay."
707,Open window…
707,The most important information is usually the most recent one… So arrange everything in the latest order and start send…
MC,It looks like you’ve done this before. Hmm…
707,It’s what I’ve always done.
707,"But if you increase the speed, the system’s going to have to work that much harder… It might get overheated so we have to be careful."
MC,"Seven, are you transferring the information already? You’re so fast."
707,It’s what I do all the time.
707,I’m not proud of it. But you have to watch over the transfer process. We have to do it fast so you use 100% of the power. Then the central system might get over heated.
707,!?
MC,Saeran…?
Saeran,Hello.
Saeran,"Nice to see you again, should I say…?"
707,Saeran!
MC,Who…!?
Saeran,You two seem really friendly. Doesn’t suit you.
707,Saeran…!
Saeran,I expected this. I knew you’d come here first if you come to Magenta.
Saeran,I’ve been seeing traces of an anonymous hacker hacking into our system. I knew it was you.
Saeran,"But I had no idea you hacked into the satellite to see the exteriors. You found our blind spot and got it. I admit, you’re pretty good."
MC,What are you going to do with us!?
Saeran,I don’t have any plans yet.
Saeran,Maybe I should start thinking about that.
707,…Saeran.
Saeran,Don’t look so surprised. I just came here because I found our security cameras were hacked. I was a bit surprised too. I thought you’d come here after your ‘party’ or whatever.
MC,"Seven, shouldn’t we run?"
Saeran,You’re very naive.
Saeran,It’s not that you’re not running. It’s that you can’t.
Saeran,Who knows? I might have installed a bomb here.
707,I didn’t find anything like that when I looked into it…
Saeran,"If you can do it, I can do it too~ Don’t be so naive."
Saeran,That’s that… But you came here before the ‘RFA party’….
Saeran,You were faster than I expected.
707,So you knew about the party…
707,"I don’t know what to say… There are so many things I want to ask, to say."
Saeran,I suppose.
707,Saeran… We really need to talk. Can’t we look past all those emotions for now and talk?
Saeran,Talk? Talking… with someone who secretly entered another person’s home to steal information…
Saeran,Stop treating me like an idiot. I’m sick of not doing anything and falling for your lies.
MC,"Seven, did you do something wrong to Saeran?"
Saeran,The word wrong doesn’t even begin to describe what he did.
Saeran,He abandoned his little brother who absolutely trusted him and ran away.
Saeran,"Oh, no I said it wrong."
Saeran,It’d be more exact to say that he comfortably used his brother who absolutely trusted him and ran away on his own.
MC,Sarean… still please listen. nothing will change just by you listening.
Saeran,Why should I listen to that woman?
707,"Saeran,"
707,if you’re talking about our childhood… there’s a misunderstanding…
Saeran,"Is that how you’re going to justify it, a misunderstanding? I guess you have an ego then?"
Saeran,You used your own brother to escape that hellish house. I guess you don’t want to admit that.
707,No… I didn’t use you.
Saeran,Then how else would you put it?
707,I left to help you. You’d understand if you listen to my side of the story…
Saeran,‘To help me’…? Is that your excuse now?
Saeran,I expected it but you’re still not honest.
Saeran,"MC, you be careful too. Didn’t he tell you that he’d protect you, make you happy…?"
Saeran,As someone who’s been there before… don’t trust him on that. He’ll abandon you too one day.
MC,"Saeran, I’m sure there’s a misunderstanding. Please listen to what Seven has to say."
Saeran,Hahaha! That woman is totally brainwashed.
707,No!
707,Please.. just please listen to me.
Saeran,"If you’re going to spill out another lie, then no need. I know the truth now."
MC,I’ll be the judge of that.
Saeran,Oh~ She’s pretty brave.
Saeran,But isn’t this too foolish for a person who’s her own judge?
Saeran,You followed a guy who’d abandon you when things go bad.
707,Please don’t say that to MC…
Saeran,Oh?
707,Saeran.
707,I did not tell you lies when we were little.
707,"I meant everything. I meant when I said I’d protect you, that I’d get us out of there together… I swear."
Saeran,you want me to believe that?
707,I changed my name and became a secret agent not to just abandon you and live a good life on my own.
707,I believed that we had to part ways first and change our identities to excape our father’s eyes.
Saeran,Who thought of that insane idea?
707,V did. And… V promised that Rika and you will take good care of you once I leave…!
707,I trusted his promise and left. It was so hard to leave you Saeran… Really.
MC,Believe what you want to believe. It’s up to you.
Saeran,I’m honored that you respect my freedom.
707,Saeran… please listen to me.
Saeran,"No, you listen this time."
MC,And last time when he saw you… that’s when he realized that V didn’t keep his promise.
Saeran,That’s fairly convincing… A lot of people would fall for that!
707,I didn’t make this up! It’s the truth!
Saeran,But you’re not just any other liar…
Saeran,I have another believable story. Want to listen?
Saeran,This is how it started. That man who lived in a hellish home saw his weak brother and got the courage to escape one day.
Saeran,Oh! I can use weak Saeran as bait and comfortably escape that monster of a mother! But I feel bad for him now. I’ll have to take good care of him…
Saeran,Since I feel like I’m living a better life when I see my weak brother.
Saeran,"But one day I’ll leave this place, team up with V to create RFA, have parties, chat online, and have fun!"
Saeran,Saeran is just a burden… Yeah! I’ll feel much better to just disappear without a word~!
707,That’s not true! How could you think that…!
707,I left without a word… because I thought mom would find out if I told you beforehand…!
Saeran,"Oh, so that’s what you intended~ Once you find out how miserable I was with that woman alone after you left, you won’t be able to say that."
MC,"Whatever happened, Seven was wrong to leave."
Saeran,That woman has it right.
Saeran,No excuse will do.
Saeran,You knew better than anyone else how your brother would live without you!
707,….
Saeran,"At first, I looked for you… The sun came up and the morning came in that hell, but you weren’t there."
Saeran,"I looked and looked. I was so worried. I worried that you might be dead, that our father got to you…!"
Saeran,"I cried for days. No matter how many times that woman strangled me, hit me, threatened me for being noisy, the naive me cried for days missing you."
Saeran,"Did he leave because he was sick of me? Was he mad at me? Still, he’ll come back. Yes, he’s my brother… my brother… brother…!"
707,Saeran…
Saeran,"I thought you were dead. But… once I found out that you were alive, the shock… haha… I won’t be able to put into words."
707,"Saeran, I swear… I thought everyone would live once I leave. If I knew that you were having a hard time, I would have…!"
Saeran,No need to write a novel. You’ve never saved me. You’ve pushed me into a deep dark hole of despair.
Saeran,"If I hadn’t met my savior, I would have lived a miserable life with that woman and starved to death with shackles on my ankles."
MC,Savior?
707,What the hell happened after I left!?
Saeran,You want to know so you can use me more? I’m not that little weak Saeran you used to know.
MC,Who should I believe..?
Saeran,I understand it’s hard for you to decide right now.
Saeran,"To you, this might be a petty story… but this was cold harsh reality to me."
Saeran,You don’t know how I felt as I hacked to traced you for years…! You will never understand everything I went through!
707,I’m sorry…
Saeran,You’re apologizing now?
707,I believed that V and Rika saved you and that you were happy… But… I was a fool to have believed that. I’m so sorry that I couldn’t protect you till the end…!
Saeran,don’t apologize now! Nothing will change. You liar… traitor…!
707,Saeran…
Saeran,You’re really mistaken if you think I’ll forgive you just with that.
707,"I tried to find out how you were doing even after I became a secret agent. I wasn’t allowed to, but I knew that I’d never feel okay without knowing that you’re happy…"
707,So I asked Rika how you were doing…!
707,"Please believe me. Everything I’m saying is the truth. The year I turned 20, Rika gave me a floppy disc without letting the agency know. Inside were pictures of you and what she wrote… I believed all that."
Saeran,Yeah right… None of that happened. You’re making it up.
707,Here… Look at what’s in this floppy disc.
Saeran,"No way that exists! I don’t believe it. Whatever that’s in there, you’ve just made it up."
Saeran,You’re trying to hurt me again. You’re a hacker. I know that you’re good at forging believable fake information!
MC,(Inserts floppy disc into the computer.)
Saeran,That woman… Don’t touch my computer!
MC,"Seven, just show it to him."
707,…Letting you see might be more effective.
Saeran,…!
707,Saeran… please just believe me.
Saeran,this photo…!
Saeran,How?
707,Do you remember when this photo was taken?
Saeran,No way… Why is that photo with you…!
707,Here’s a letter Rika wrote to me… Look.
Saeran,This is a lie…
707,Saeran!
Saeran,I don’t believe it. No… No…
707,What in the world happened to you!?
Saeran,….I don’t want to listen to you.
Saeran,You just stole that photo… and put it in that disc. And that letter… I’m sure you wrote it.
707,No Rika gave this to me herself.
Saeran,Shut up!! It’s all just a lie! You just made it up!
707,"Saeran… Calm down, please."
Saeran,Don’t come near me!!
Saeran,"If you come near me, or tell me any more lies… I’m going to kill you."
707,Saeran..
Saeran,Don’t say that name!!
707,Saeran..!!
MC,Seven… should we run after him?
707,Of course! But…!
707,The door’s locked…!
707,"We have to open it, hurry…"
707,"I can’t let Saeran go, MC…"
707,I won’t leave him like I did 7 years ago! Never… I’ll never let him go.
JUMIN,MC.
JUMIN,I’m glad you’re here.
JUMIN,I tried calling V…
MC,Did he take it ?
JUMIN,I got a signal but he didn’t pick up.
JUMIN,"He picked up once, but all I heard was cars for a while and the call ended."
MC,Cars?
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,I think he was going somewhere.
JUMIN,"Anyways,"
JUMIN,how are things going?
MC,Jumin… Seven and I are locked in right now.
JUMIN,What?
JUMIN,Locked in there?
707,Junhib1
JUMIN,"Luciel, are you okay?"
707,Yup.
707,I’m safe.
707,"MC,"
707,The hacking program is still running.
MC,Please explain the situation to Jumin.
JUMIN,What in the world is happening?
707,I saw Saeran?
JUMIN,Were you two caught?
707,"Yes, only to Saeran."
707,But he ran away.
707,I’m shaking right now…
707,"We met Saeran while I was transferring the data,"
707,"and I tried to solve the misunderstanding,"
707,but it didn’t work out and he ran off.
707,The door automatically locks form the outsinde
707,so it doesn’t open from the inside.
JUMIN,That’s why you’re hacking the door.
707,Yes…
707,"We’ll get out of here safe, right…?"
MC,We will! Don’t lose faith.
JUMIN,Yes.
JUMIN,"You’d know better,"
JUMIN,but getting nervous is poison for situations like that.
707,"Yes, you’re right… no panicking."
JUMIN,"And,"
JUMIN,"if you let me know what Saeran’s wearing, I can send people over and have them find him."
JUMIN,Or at least help you get out safe.
707,"Thank you,"
707,but I don’t want to make a fuss out of this already.
MC,Haven’t we already made a fuss? ;;
707,I’ve been looking at the security cameras
707,and thankfully I don’t think anyone else knows we’re here…
707,I’ll just have to do my best to get out of here for now.
707,Both of you…
707,thank you for putting me back to my sense.
707,I can’t even imagine how I would have gotten through this if I were alone.
MC,"You can do it, Seven..!"
707,Okay…
707,I’ll focus!
707,Oh… the program’s stopped.
707,"I’ll come back later, Jumin."
JUMIN,"Okay, good luck."
JUMIN,I hope he does his best
JUMIN,and both of you come back safely…
MC,"Everything will be fine, Jumin. I’ll get going too."
JUMIN,Alright.
JUMIN,I don’t want to interfere.
JUMIN,See you both later.
Saeran,"No, no…!! no…! It, it can’t be!"
Saeran,"It’s all lies Luciel made up, all lies… lies…"
Saeran,He hacked to steal that photo… yes…!
Saeran,That letter… is fake..
Saeran,I won’t believe him… I won’t believe Saeyoung.
Saeran,Saeyoung abandoned me. He left me… he left me….
Vanderwood,"Oh, you ran away but now you’ve come on your own?"
Saeran,"He left me, he left, he abandoned me… Saeyoung abandoned me. That’s what the savior told me…"
Vanderwood,What are you muttering?
Saeran,He abandoned me… he left…
Vanderwood,You’re muttering… and you’re wearing fancy clothes… are you insane…?
Vanderwood,Hey! Wake up!
Saeran,!?
Vanderwood,Yoy thought I wouldn’t see you? I’ve been doing this for years. You’re wrong if you think changing your appearance would fool me.
Saeran,…You’re Luciel’s assistant. Why are you here?
Vanderwood,What?Your acting’s improved. Or did your client get to your something? You look out of your mind.
Saeran,What?
Vanderwood,"Shh. Regardless of what’s happened to you, I have to take care of my work. This thing I’ve put right up close to your side. It’s not a toy, it’s a real gun."
Vanderwood,"I’m sorry this day’s come. I should have been more uptight with you. I gave you too much freedom. It’s technically my fault… but in this world, what matters is who survives."
Saeran,What are you talking about. I’m not 707…!!
Vanderwood,"I almost feel pity seeing you be so ridiculous…. Hey, get in."
Saeran,Let me go! What is this! Let me go!!
Vanderwood,What kind of idiot would let go the person they came to find?
Vanderwood,Hurry and get in here…! I can’t take you out here.
Saeran,Let… let me go!!
Vanderwood,God so annoying. You’re probably the only person who won’t give in even with a gun in your face.
Saeran,Uhhpp… uhp!!!
Vanderwood,Whew. Got him alive. I’ll call the boss on my way back.
V,That red hair…?
ZEN,MC!
ZEN,I’m so glad you’re back!
MC,Is RFA doing okay?
ZEN,We’re fine.
ZEN,You really don’t have to worry about us.
ZEN,"You and Seven aren’t still locked it, right?"
YOOSUNG,Gahh…
YOOSUNG,MC!!!
YOOSUNG,Are you okay?
MC,We’re safe. We are still locked in…
ZEN,What?
YOOSUNG,I’m so glad you’re safe though!!! T0T
ZEN,But why can’t you get out?
ZEN,I thought he could hack int anything…
YOOSUNG,I think he’s just nervous T_T
YOOSUNG,He saw his brother too…
ZEN,But why is the door locked!?
YOOSUNG,That Saeran person…
YOOSUNG,I guess there was a big problem with Seven T_T
ZEN,Yeah; I’m sure it’s a complicated story.
YOOSUNG,"MC, how’s Seven doing?"
MC,Seven will be here soon.
ZEN,I wish he’d come right now…
YOOSUNG,YEah T_T
YOOSUNG,I want to know if he’s okay.
707,Zen
707,Yoosung
ZEN,Oh!
YOOSUNG,"Seven,"
YOOSUNG,I’m glad that MC came here first
YOOSUNG,but I was worried!
ZEN,How’s everything going?
707,It’s being delayed a bit
707,but the door will open soon.
YOOSUNG,Thank god…
ZEN,You’re with MC right?
707,Of course.
707,She’s right beside me.
707,And she’s not hurt.
ZEN,Thank god…
YOOSUNG,So you’re going to go look for your brother!?
MC,Yes!
707,But…
707,The security cameras aren’t showing any traces of Saeran…
707,I think we should leave the building first…
707,You don’t know when danger will come at you.
ZEN,"Yeah,"
ZEN,just get out of there!
YOOSUNG,Seven…
YOOSUNG,So you’re coming back home now?
MC,We can’t leave until we find Saeran and the truth.
707,I’m grateful that MC’s thinking the same thing.
707,"I wanted to tell everyone directly, but I’ll just say it here…"
707,"First, I plan to get out of here"
707,and go to the safest location possible
707,and analyze the data I’ve retrieved.
ZEN,So you can’t come back for now…
707,No…
707,I just came here to let everyone know that we’re safe.
707,I have to leave again.
707,"I don’t think Saeran’s told anyone that we’re here,"
707,but you don’t know when they’ll catch us…
ZEN,Yeah!
ZEN,Let us know
ZEN,when you’ve gone to some place safe!
707,Ok
707,Thanks.
MC,We’ll be in touch again!
YOOSUNG,"I hope next time we hear from you, you guys are some place safe T_T"
ZEN,Don’t worry about us and just do what you have to do!
707,Okay.. I’ll get going.
Saeran,God… Saeyoung? Saeyoung….?
Saeran,"Who… are you? This isn’t my home… I was on my way to get something for mommy, and everything went dark.."
Saeran,What…? Savior…? I don’t know what you mean… Did my father send you?
Saeran,I have to go home. Mommy will get so mad! What do I do… I’m not used to going out. Mom daid she’d hit me if I’m late. Please send me back home…!
Saeran,And… Saeyoung might come back today…
Saeran,Start what… up… uhp…!!
Saeran,Ugh… What….
JAEHEE,MC!
JAEHEE,I’m glad I came here as soon as the meeting ended.
JUMIN,I’m glad you’re here. Do you have any news?
MC,We’re currently leaving the building through blind spots.
JAEHEE,I’m so glad that you’re not hurt.
JAEHEE,We feel very anxious just watching.
JUMIN,I see.
JAEHEE,Mr. han.
JAEHEE,can we really proceed with the party when two of our members are in such danger?
JUMIN,"Luciel said that they will go to a safe location, so we’ll have to trust him."
JAEHEE,I don’t think that we can let our guards down just by faith.
JUMIN,We’ve done all we could already.
JUMIN,I understand that it’s difficult to focus on the party…
JAEHEE,I know that we can’t stop it.
JUMIN,Yes.
MC,"V’s coming to the party, right?"
JAEHEE,"Oh, since you’ve mentioned him…"
JAEHEE,we still have not been able to reach V.
JUMIN,He might be avoiding us.
JAEHEE,It’s very shocking…
JAEHEE,I never thought this day would come.
JAEHEE,I’m almost angry at V myself.
JUMIN,…
MC,I should go back to Seven now. Cheer up both of you!
JAEHEE,"Okay, I pray that you both get out safe."
JUMIN,Don’t worry about us and be careful.
JAEHEE,I’ll go and confirm for the last time that the party is well prepared.
JUMIN,"Yes, I’ll let you know if I hear anything."
JAEHEE,Thank you.
707,MC…! This way.
MC,I think we missed Saeran…
707,I want to believe that we’ll catch him soon…
707,Seeing that he hasn’t told anyone that we’ve gone in… he’s either shocked at what I told him or changed his feelings about me.
707,Huh…? What is this…
707,Tire marks…
MC,"Someone must have driven off quickly… It’s not Saeran’s car, is it..?"
707,It might be…
707,But we don’t have enough evidence to go after it.
707,"First… we have to go somewhere safe, so get in the car."
707,…I wish we soulc find Saeran fast…
MC,V?
707,V…?
V,"Luciel, thank god… It’s you."
707,Why are you here?
V,"Oh, that…"
707,Don’t say anything weird and answer me. Why are you here?
707,"Oh, of course… you knew about this place, right?"
707,"I’m not even surprised… you’re with them, aren’t you?"
V,I know that you won’t believe anything I say.
V,So you won’t be able to accept it even if I tell you why I’m here.
707,MC! Get in the car. This might be dangerous.
V,You don’t have to put your guards against me. I will never hurt you.
707,You want me to believe that? Don’t come near me. I won’t stay put if you come.
V,Luciel…
707,Who the hell are you? Reveal yourself.
707,How the hell did you know what was in that drawer?
707,Rika was the only one who could go into that apartment…! You’re the worst kind of fraud to lie with such an innocent face.
V,I’m sorry… I can’t tell you right now.
V,I’m so sorry…
707,You’re not going to say anything about Saeran?
707,You’re not going to tell me what the hell you did to him?!
707,He didn’t even listen to me. He just said that I was lying…
707,Why the hell does he think I’m a lier!!
707,Did you brainwashed my brother!?
V,Luciel…
707,Tell me whatever excuse you have…
707,"You’re Mint Eye’s leader, not RFA’s?"
707,You’re just pretending that you were attacked by the person you love and turned blind so that no one can suspect you!?
MC,What is that about?
707,"You explain, V."
707,Say something with that noble mouth of yours you promised so many things with!
V,"Luciel, first try to calm down…"
707,Calm down… in this situation?
V,I’m sorry. There’s nothing else I can say…
V,About Saeran.. It’s just that I know how much you love him so I didn’t want you to know.
707,Don’t give me that excuse… I hate you.
V,Luciel…
707,"I will never forgive you. You’re the reason why Saeran’s like that, and why I became a secret agent… That’s the truth."
V,…Yes.
707,You’re the one who made me and Saeran part ways.
V,Saeyoung… just listen to this one thing.
707,Don’t say my name.
V,You won’t believe me now… but I think I should tell you one last thing.
V,Please believe me… this is the truth.
V,I think I saw Saeran here earlier.
707,What?
V,I can’t see very well so I wasn’t sure but since you’re here… Saeran must have been the one dragged away.
707,I won’t forgive you if you’re lying.
V,I swear. But I couldn’t see it properly.
V,I don’t know who took him…
V,"but they got in some car… It was a red one, really noticeable…"
V,I think there was a silver lining…
707,Silver lining?
707,No way those tire marks… They looked like mar car…!
MC,Seven! Have tou ever lent anyone your car?
707,No…
707,But I know one person who has access to them.
707,vanderwood… I’m sure she’s the one who took my car.
V,Vanderwood?
707,If you’re lying about seeing Saeran… I’m really not going to let you go.
V,I swear… It’s the truth.
707,MC…. I think she mistook Saeran as me.
707,Vanderwood would never let Saeran just go…!
MC,How the hell does the agency operate?
707,I ran off without completing my job… I’m sure she received orders to find me and take me out.
V,"Saeyoung, I’d like to help… but you probably won’t trust me."
707,You know very well. What are you going to help with now?
707,I’ll never let you make me miss Saeran again.
V,Saeyoung…
707,"MC, get in. We’re leaving."
707,"Oh, right."
707,V.
V,Yes?
707,If Rika knew the real you… I now get why she messed up your eyes like that.
707,"If your eyes really do hurt, just become blind. I don’t want anyone to be fooled by those sincere looking eyes."
V,…
V,Yes… This is all my fault for loving her.
V,Hello everyone.
V,I’m so sorry I came back so late.
V,I apologize… for not being in touch.
V,I’m sure everyone has a lot of questions.
V,"Concerning Rika, Saeran… and Mint Eye."
V,I don’t know where to start.
V,I always thought that carrying the burden of secrets alone was protecting everyone…
V,The secret was so heavy and so horrible that I thought I should be the only one to suffer.
V,This might sound like a petty excuse to everyone….
V,but I don’t want to avoid blame for how things got so complicated.
V,"I don’t know if you’ll believe me, bit I tried to protect you all with everything I have, and I always will…"
V,But…
V,"Now that I’ve lost everyone’s trust, I don’t think I can be the leader now."
V,Jumin’s been doing a good job taking care of the party without me.
V,I hope he continues to do so from now on.
V,I will no longer be the leader of RFA.
V,I’m so sorry I can’t answer everyone’s questions.
V,Rather than trying to figure out the reason… please just hate me for keeping all thse secrets.
V,I’m sure that you will have more questions
V,after I leave.
V,"Then, don’t hesitate and just hate me."
V,"In the end, it’s all my fault"
V,that everyone’s having such a hard time.
V,Thank you so much for being so loyal until now.
V,Please just…be disappointed in me.
V,I hope everyone is well.
V,Bye forever.
V,"I love you, Rika."
V,You will always be in me.
Rika,I’m inside the sun.
Rika,I will be born again inside of you.
Rika,I’m going to stop thinking about the abandoned past. It will only bring more fear.
Rika,I want to be in the present. I want to be in this moment where I love you.
Rika,"This moment where I’m looking at you, this moment we’re making together… I cherish it so much."
Rika,"V you are my sun, and I am your sun."
YOOSUNG,MC!
YOOSUNG,"You and Seven are safe, right?"
MC,Yes… we’re moving to a safe location.
YOOSUNG,I’m so glad to hear that T_T
YOOSUNG,But
YOOSUNG,V just came…?
YOOSUNG,V…
YOOSUNG,he left the worst words possible.
YOOSUNG,I thought there’d be some long explanation
YOOSUNG,but he didn’t explain a thing.
YOOSUNG,"He pretended as if he’s taking all the burden, but he just ran off."
YOOSUNG,So irresponsible…
YOOSUNG,I’m almost embarrassed that I once trusted him…
MC,He met us. We didn’t even tell him the address but he showed up.
YOOSUNG,You met him when you didn’t tell him the address?
YOOSUNG,How in the world?
ZEN,MC… You must be safe to be here.
YOOSUNG,Zen.
ZEN,"You read what V wrote, right?"
YOOSUNG,Yes.
ZEN,So he’s leaving the RFA!?
YOOSUNG,Ya;;;;;;
ZEN,Wait.
ZEN,What the hell did
ZEN,MC just say?
ZEN,V was at the Mint Eye headquarters?
YOOSUNG,God…
JAEHEE,I couldn’t not come here after reading the last conversation.
JAEHEE,But…
MC,Jaehee… We met V here. I’m so shocked.
JAEHEE,…
JAEHEE,I still had hope…
JAEHEE,But V completely disappointed my hopes and left.
ZEN,Jaehee…
YOOSUNG,I don’t ever want to see him again.
YOOSUNG,I hope he never comes here either.
ZEN,God…
ZEN,Shouldn’t he at least tell us that face to face?
MC,I suppose he has too many secrets to do that.
ZEN,I can’t believe he just left after saying what he wanted to say…
JAEHEE,…He’s abandoned everything he’s done for himself to keep that secret. I wonder what it is.
JAEHEE,Mr. Han.
MC,Jumin…
ZEN,???;;;
YOOSUNG,Jumin;
JAEHEE,Oh…
MC,"Jaehee, I think something’s wrong with Jumin. Shouldn’t you give him a call?"
JAEHEE,I should.
JAEHEE,I feel very nervous too.
ZEN,Please let us know if there’s anything we can do to help.
ZEN,"He was super close with V, so I’m sure he’s shocked."
JAEHEE,"Yes, I should call him."
JAEHEE,I’ll get going.
YOOSUNG,V’s seriously…
YOOSUNG,I feel worse the more I get mad…
ZEN,Yeah…
ZEN,You never feel good after getting mad.
YOOSUNG,But I feel so frustrated to stay still.
ZEN,I’m glad at least MC and Seven are safe.
MC,I think Seven is just as shocked.
ZEN,I understand…
ZEN,I feel like my mind’s been torn apart…
ZEN,I can’t believe that V left RFA so irresponsibly…
ZEN,And he was at the Mint Eye buildings?
ZEN,It’s almost surreal…
ZEN,How long do you think he’s been lying to us?
YOOSUNG,Zen…
YOOSUNG,This might sound a bit funny…
ZEN,What is it?
YOOSUNG,Can I go to your place if it’s okay?
YOOSUNG,I can’t be alone right now.
MC,That’s a good idea. You guys can comfort each other.
YOOSUNG,I feel like going insane being on my own.
ZEN,You can come.
ZEN,Hurry.
YOOSUNG,Then excuse me.
ZEN,I’m glad you’re coming.
YOOSUNG,I’ll leave right now.
ZEN,We can go to the party together tomorrow.
YOOSUNG,Okay!
YOOSUNG,"If you hear from Seven, then just call me!"
ZEN,Ok
YOOSUNG,"MC,"
YOOSUNG,Seven must be busy driving…
YOOSUNG,but tell him I said hello.
MC,"Okay, I will. Everyone try to calm down. The party’s tomorrow."
ZEN,We’re all gathering because of the party…
ZEN,but we’ll just have a meeting instead.
ZEN,Now that our leader’s suddenly left…
YOOSUNG,I don’t think it’ll matter since he never did anything in the first place.
ZEN,Well… that’s true.
ZEN,"Yoosung, be careful on your way."
YOOSUNG,"Ok, see you soon!"
ZEN,Gahh…
ZEN,What the hell is happening…
ZEN,I actually feel glad that Yoosung’s coming over;;
ZEN,God…
ZEN,"You’re really okay, right?"
MC,I’m just worried that Seven seems really hurt.
ZEN,Yeah…
ZEN,Even I wouldn’t know how to comfort him right now…
ZEN,I’ll just have to leave it to you. I’m sorry.
ZEN,I should go clean the house before Yoosung gets here
ZEN,and organize my thoughts a bit.
ZEN,"I’d like to go for some shots,"
ZEN,but I have to take care of my skin for the party tomorrow;;;
MC,I should get going too. I should at least try to comfort Seven.
ZEN,"Yup, go ahead."
ZEN,Staring at the phone only makes me feel more complicated.
ZEN,I should get up and go clean.
ZEN,See you later.
MC,we’re the only one here…
707,Yeah.
707,We’re the only ones in this abandoned cabin
707,and we’re the only ones in the messenger…
707,It’s late
707,I guess everyone’s sleeping.
707,V…
707,is ridiculous until the end.
707,MC…
707,I’m sure you were really shocked
707,when you saw V at Mint Eye’s headquarters.
MC,"Yes, I think my heart is still racing."
707,I’ve never ever told him where we were and he just suddenly appeared..
707,I’m sure that V knew about this place all along.
707,I’m sure he’s involved in Mint Eye.
707,All the RFA members will be shocked again once they read this.
707,I’m a bit worried.
707,"As soon as we go back,"
707,I’ll have to block V from the messenger.
707,We can’t let him read our conversations.
MC,You were working on your computer earlier. What were you doing?
707,I’ve been hacking into the agency I worked for.
707,It is very difficult to get in.
707,But not impossible.
707,I have to do something
707,to make sure Vanderwood can’t do anything bad to Saeran..
MC,I’m feel bad for Saeran.
707,You’re not the one who should be feeling bad. I am.
707,I should have finished my job properly and come here.
707,I’m so angry at myself…
707,So…
707,I’m going to give up everything I have to save Saeran.
707,Even if I have to sacrifice myself.. he has to live.
707,We have to get on moving as soon as we figure out where Vanderwood is.
707,But… I don’t think this will go fast.
707,So… we’ll have to postpone going back to everyone.
MC,I’ll be with you until the end.
707,Thank you…
707,I think you’re the only reason why nothing has happened to me.
707,Thank you so much for being so calm when were in danger because of Saeran earlier.
707,MC…
707,I think my life changed completely after you showed up.
707,You were with me when I was bright and fun…
707,and you stuck by my side when it was hard and miserable…
707,I’ve never had anyone like that in my life.
707,So…
707,I’m sure that you had a hard time in the process of discovering the new me.
707,I’m sorry.
707,For hurting your feelings…
707,And thank you for withstanding all that.
707,Thank you for letting me know that it’s possible to live a new life.
707,"MC,"
707,you mean so much to me now
707,that I can’t even describe it.
707,This feeling…
707,I don’t know what to call it…
MC,…Is it….
707,Oh…
707,"We’re in the messenger, so I won’t talk anymore about my feelings."
707,Uhm…
707,"I,"
707,I’ll just change the subject.
707,Are you still excited for the party tomorrow?
MC,"Yes… I won’t be able to attend, but I hope it goes well."
707,I think so too.
707,I think Jumin will take good care of the party without us…
707,"We’ll be on the run tomorrow again,"
707,"and as Yoosung said,"
707,when times are tough
707,let’s think that the RFA members are our second family.
707,I…
707,I think the program’s finished running.
707,"Since every second matters right now,"
707,I’ll go work some more in the living room.
707,"MC, go to bed first."
MC,I’ll be hoping for everything to work out.
707,Yes… trust me.
707,"Hacking into an intelligence agency isn’t easy, but there’s nothing I haven’t been able to hack into yet."
707,"Then see you later, MC."
707,^^
Rika,"Saeryoung, what baptismal name do you want?"
Rika,"Father usually decides… but if there’s a name you want, I can kind of give him a hint."
Rika,How about it?
Saeyoung,There is a name I want.
Rika,What is it?
Saeyoung,Luciel.
Rika,Luciel…? That’s statn Lucifer’s old name.
Saeyoung,I know. That’s why I think it’d suit me.
Rika,Why do you want your baptismal name to come form a fallen angel?
Saeyoung,"You and V have been so nice to me, but I’ve suffered through so much darkness ever since I was born."
Saeyoung,"I may be able to have the name of an anger for now… but if I’m not careful, I might fall into a dark pit. I’m so afraid that I’ll turn into my dad or mom… that I’ll become weak and not be able to protect my brother…"
Saeyoung,"Every time someone calls me in my new life,"
Saeyoung,I want to be reminded that I shouldn’t become dark like Lucifer’s future.
Saeyoung,If Luciel gets a happy ending… then it’ll be a history changing miracle.
Rika,"Hmm, that will be hard unless we change the bible… but it might actually hapen if you try hard!"
Saeyoung,Yes… I hope so.
Saeyoung,So that I won’t become Lucifer… so that my future will be warm just as if an angel’s blessed it…
Saeyoung,So that I can make Saeran happy… I want to be the great anger Luciel.
Saeran,Saeyoung… will come and save me… Or… I’d rather die… since Saeyoung might be up there…
Saeran,I should have never been born…
Saeran,Saeyoung… where are you?
Saeran,Uhp….
Saeran,You promised we’d live together…
Saeran,You don’t have to keep that promise so… just please come…
Saeran,"We don’t have to be happy. With you, everything is okay…!"
Saeran,I can get through it… if you’re here… no matter what happens…
Saeran,Saeyoung….. my brother…
Saeran,I miss you…
Saeran,Ugh……
ZEN,Oh.. It’s Jaehee!
JAEHEE,"Zen, hello."
JAEHEE,The party will start soon..
JAEHEE,Despite all the shocking news we faced consecutively..
JAEHEE,This party would not have been possible to host if it were not for Mr. Han’s supernatural effort.
ZEN,I agree that it was not natural at all. lol
ZEN,But Jumin did seem to be shocked as well yesterday.
ZEN,Is he ok?
JAEHEE,I’m not sure..
JAEHEE,He acts like any other days
JAEHEE,But I don’t think he’s really doing well. He’s refraining from talking about V.
ZEN,It is quite shocking.. lol
ZEN,Did you read the messages from last night?
ZEN,V suddenly appears at the Mint Eye’s Headquarter···
ZEN,I don’t think I can handle more shocking information!!
ZEN,Yoosung
ZEN,Are you out of the shower?
YOOSUNG,Yes..
YOOSUNG,I still feel a bit nauseated.
ZEN,I told you not to drink too much lol
JAEHEE,Nauseated?
YOOSUNG,I’m hungover..
JAEHEE,A night before the party you drank?
ZEN,Yoosung bought some alcohol so we started drinking..
JAEHEE,…
ZEN,We not only felt back-stabbed by a person we trusted
ZEN,but rather we felt like our backbone broke due to this betrayal.
ZEN,So we gave into a adult way of dealing with pain.
YOOSUNG,Yeah..
YOOSUNG,"Man, Zen can really drink a lot."
ZEN,I wasn’t going to drink… What if anything bad happens with my beautiful skin?
YOOSUNG,How can you be fine after drinking that much last night?
ZEN,you just gotta work out regularly. lol
ZEN,Why do you cry when you’re drunk by the way?
JAEHEE,Yoosung cried?
ZEN,sniff sniff~
ZEN,He kept on saying he was sorry.
YOOSUNG,That’s embarrassing. Please forget what happened last night.
YOOSUNG,I just start crying when I drink. I don’t know why.
ZEN,Awww is that true?
ZEN,lolol
YOOSUNG,T.T
YOOSUNG,It’s not my fault. T.T
YOOSUNG,Since we’re uncovering shocking truth about V..
YOOSUNG,It’s hard to stay sober.
JAEHEE,Well that’s for everyone.
ZEN,Yup. This is the biggest betrayal I’ve faced in my life.
YOOSUNG,I don’t think it’s possible for me to be more disappointed.
YOOSUNG,You think V deceived us from the beginning?
YOOSUNG,He probably used Rika too.
YOOSUNG,How could he just move on after the love of his life pass away?
YOOSUNG,Until what is true and what is a lie..
ZEN,Yoosung…
YOOSUNG,Has he ever been truthful to us even once?
ZEN,I am leaning towards you no
ZEN,but I don’t wanna think about that at this moment.
JAEHEE,Let’s talk about this.. after the party.
JAEHEE,I don’t believe V deceived us from the beginning..
JAEHEE,But I think we must find out when he began his contact with Mint Eye.
YOOSUNG,"Well, now we’ve come to this.."
YOOSUNG,I actually think it’s good that V’s on the run.
ZEN,If V appears in my sight
ZEN,I won’t stay still.
JAEHEE,Please calm down.
JAEHEE,Violence cannot be justified under any circumstance.
ZEN,"Argh.. Jaehee, you are right."
YOOSUNG,"If V has any conscience,"
YOOSUNG,don’t you think he should’ve at least talked to us face to face?
ZEN,Exactly!!
YOOSUNG,Running away only speaks volume that he doesn’t have any conscience!
JAEHEE,This is my personal view..
JAEHEE,"I think V felt it’s was late to say this is all misunderstanding,"
JAEHEE,given the fact that Seven has clear proof that tells otherwise.
JAEHEE,So I think he just ran away as he couldn’t come up with any more excuses.
ZEN,"Well, no need to excuse him from being called a “coward” either."
JAEHEE,Mr. Han!
JAEHEE,How are gou?
YOOSUNG,Jumin!
JUMIN,I’m alright.
ZEN,Thanks for all your effort.
JUMIN,We don’t need to talk about that now.
JUMIN,I don’t want to get emotional.
ZEN,If you… need to talk
ZEN,let’s grab a drink too.
JUMIN,I don’t have time for that.
ZEN,-_-
ZEN,"Mr. CEO Han, be honest with yourself."
ZEN,Express your pain.
ZEN,How does it feel to be betrayed by a good friend
ZEN,Tell me.
ZEN,You’re human too!
JUMIN,It’s shocking.
JUMIN,I feel like crap.
JUMIN,"Shoot, I almost chose a wrong tie to wear."
ZEN,?!?!
YOOSUNG,Jumin is human! This could make the headline!
JAEHEE,Mr. Han..
JUMIN,I will not stop tracing V until I find out everything about him
JUMIN,I won’t assume that he betrayed us.
ZEN,Well.. I gotta admit that the truth isn’t revealed hundred percent yet.
JUMIN,I want to ask V why he would just run away without having a common courtesy to tell us.
YOOSUNG,Jumin..
YOOSUNG,Let’s not have high expectations. It will bring us down.
JUMIN,I don’t expect anything. I’m just doing what I have to do.
JUMIN,Please excuse me. I have to check something for the party.
YOOSUNG,Jumin..
YOOSUNG,"Even though he’s calm and collected, I think he’s sad inside.."
YOOSUNG,Am I the only one noticing that?
ZEN,That’s quite sad..
YOOSUNG,I think Jumin really wanted to believe V till the end.
ZEN,Yeah. He wants to sound neutral but..
YOOSUNG,He must feel so terrible because this party was intended for all of us to reunite.
ZEN,I do give him credit for Jumin’s sense of responsibility.
JAEHEE,I do too.
YOOSUNG,Look at what V’s putting us through.
ZEN,Sigh.. Let’s stop talking about him then.
JAEHEE,Right. Nothing but frustration comes out of talking further.
JAEHEE,"Anyways,"
JAEHEE,it’s a shame that MC and Seven can’t make it
JAEHEE,since they really contributed to hosting this party.
JAEHEE,"Also, we were able to find out the truth because of those two."
ZEN,Right..
ZEN,"Even though we still have a bit more to go in finding out everything,"
ZEN,they still did a marvelous job in digging out some information.
YOOSUNG,I want to see Seven and MC.
ZEN,"Seven posted a photo of MC, remember?"
JAEHEE,I guess we would have to be thankful for even  a photo for now.
YOOSUNG,You know what I mean. I wanna see that person in a photo breathing and living before me!
YOOSUNG,T.T
ZEN,In conclusion…
ZEN,Three of our members are not coming to the party..
JAEHEE,That’s correct.
ZEN,That’s discouraging for some reason.
JAEHEE,I’d be lying to if I said I’m not discouraged.
JAEHEE,But
JAEHEE,we have to keep our morale high for the party.
YOOSUNG,"Jaehee, cheer up."
ZEN,We are together in this.
YOOSUNG,Even if we can’t see Seven and MC today
YOOSUNG,I hope we do next time.
ZEN,Given the circumstance..
YOOSUNG,Don’t be so sad!
YOOSUNG,Even though we couldn’t be together at the party
YOOSUNG,We’re still one big family.
YOOSUNG,Let’s focus on hosting this party successfully
YOOSUNG,which will lay down the foundation for
YOOSUNG,"Seven, MC, and Seven’s brother"
YOOSUNG,to come back.
ZEN,I’m impressed!
JAEHEE,Amazing speech.
ZEN,You’re right!
ZEN,Let’s cheer up and get ourselves together for this family!
YOOSUNG,Shall we go out now?
ZEN,Yes. I’m ready.
JAEHEE,Are you leaving for the party now?
ZEN,Yup!
ZEN,I’ll get going then.
ZEN,See you at the party!
YOOSUNG,Zen! Did you get the list?
ZEN,I sure did.
ZEN,I cannot afford to make a mistake since I’m greeting the guests on behalf of MC.
JAEHEE,That’d be much appreciated.
JAEHEE,I’ll be waiting.
YOOSUNG,See you later!
JAEHEE,Mr. Han is taking charge of the indoors event
JAEHEE,so I’m going to take care of parking situation and go in as well.
JAEHEE,I’ll see everyone at the party then.
ZEN,"Seven’s not here, Rika’s not here… and nether is MC and V. It feels so empty."
ZEN,I just wanted to see MC’s face…
Yoosung,There aren’t that many guests so it feels more empty… I can tell Jumin worked really hard. This is sad…
ZEN,We should just be thankful that we managed to have the party with all that went on.
Yoosung,I guess the two of them are traveling safe…?
ZEN,"Well, I’d call it more of an adventure."
Yoosung,I hope they find his brother and come back to us.
ZEN,You’ve been saying that every hour since last night.
Yoosung,I know I’m just repeating myself. Oh… I think Jaehee’s going to give a speech.
ZEN,"Oh, yeah."
Jaehee,"Thank you so much for attending the party today. I am Jaehee Kang, the host of this RFA party."
Jaehee,"Although we do not have very many guests, thank you all for coming here."
Jaehee,A couple of the hosts have not been able to attend the party.
Jaehee,"I cannot reveal any details,but they send their apologies."
Jaehee,"The leader of our organization V was also not able to attend due to health reasons… but as we have always done, V’s photographs will be auctioned off today so please stay with us until the end."
Jaehee,C&R’s representative Director Jumin Han will give the commemorating speech instead of V.
Jaehee,"Please come up to the stage, Mr. Han."
Yoosung,It’s Jumin!
Jumin,Hello ladies and gentleman.
Jumin,I’m honored to meet all of the guests at this party. We plan to use the funds from this party to more creatively and efficiently help those in need. This charity event is more meaningful in that it will provide a stepping stone for us to keep on improving.
Jumin,The RFA party will continue. And all members will participate in the next party which ‘m sure will be larger.
Jumin,"Although she’s not here, our new member has taken over the founder, Rika’s role to make this party possible. We thank her very much."
Jumin,May God’s blessing be upon those who could not attend today…
ZEN,…What’s up with him?
Yoosung,Maybe because Seven… no Saeyoung is Catholic?
Jumin,The auction will begin two hours from now. Thank you.
707,"in the name of the Father, of the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen. Father, I couldn’t come here for a long time. I was caught up with the ugly reality in front of my eyes and forgot the importance of love."
707,"I have a confession to make. When I was little, I did not believe in God. I went to Church because I saw people there who lived different, better lives than I did. I wanted to be a part of them."
707,"I was happy that at Church, I was at least treated like a human being."
707,"After losing my brother, changing my identity several times, taking dangerous jobs, and just wasting a lot of money… I did not live an honest, true life."
707,I didn’t deserved to be loved.
707,But I was wrong. There was someone in this Earth who loves me. I encountered the holiest of love inside her.
707,I realized that this is fate… this is a miracle… that this is love…! God does exist… So I’ve come here to promise to you.
707,I promise to treat her as the most precious person to me. I promise to love her endlessly until my last breath…
707,"Dear Lord, please listen to my heart… my promise. I will live my life with truth and love."
707,"no matter what hardship faces me, I will solemnly speak the truth in front of my love and protect her."
707,I pray again and again so that my last day is the day I protect this person with the most beautiful heart.
707,MC… I promise under God’s eyes that I will protect and love you until the day I die.
707,Amen.
707,Shall we start again after a kiss?
ZEN,"Seven’s not here, Rika’s not here… and V’s not here either."
Yoosung,Let’s be fabulous on our own. Zen.. did you meet all the guests?
ZEN,"Yes, I’ve been going around saying hello."
ZEN,MC’s amazing to have gathered so many people in such a short time.
Yoosung,Yeah I know.
Yoosung,Oh… I think Jaehee’s about to give a speech.
ZEN,"Where, where?"
Jaehee,Thank you all so much for attending our party today. My name is Jaehee Kang. I’m a member of the RFA.
Jaehee,"I hope you get a lot out of the party, as you’ve decided to come on such short notice."
Jaehee,But despite such a great turnout… a couple hosts have not been able to attend.
Jaehee,"I cannot reveal the details, but they send their apologies."
Jaehee,"The leader of the organization, V, has also been unable to attend due to health reasons… but as we’ve done every year, we will still be auctioning off his photographs, so please wait for that."
Jaehee,C&R’s representative Director Jumin Han will deliver the congratulatory address instead of V.
Jaehee,"Please come up to the stage, Mr. Han."
Yoosung,It’s Jumin!
Jumin,"Hello, ladies and gentleman."
Jumin,I’m so glad to meet you all at the party…
Jumin,but I was quite angry this morning.
ZEN,Can he say that?
Yoosung,Whatever… It’s a miracle that we’re having this party.
Jumin,"Half of the members of the RFA, the hosts of this party, have not been able to attend."
Jumin,"Even if they had no other choice but to… this is very sad. This party has always aimed to help those in need, but it also meant a lot in that we all had a chance to see each other."
Jumin,"But… instead of getting angry, I decided to be thankful that we are having this party."
Jumin,"Ever since Rika, who founded the RFA, passed away, there was no hope that we’d have any parties again."
Jumin,"We have a new member who’s led us in arranging the party, taking after Rika’s work. Without her, the RFA would have had no future."
Jumin,I also feel very sorry for the new member. Since there was a lot of inconvenience… with the RFA not being very transparent and fair.
ZEN,It wasn’t just inconvenience… her life was in danger.
Jumin,"But despite all that, they gathered the courage to go after the truth, Saeyoung Choi, and MC… We are very proud of them."
Yoosung,Oh! He called Seven’s real name!
Jumin,"The truth is admirable, but burdensome. Many people ignore the inconvenient truth for the sake of being comfortable."
Jumin,But true happiness only comes when one’s faced that inconvenience.
Jumin,"Once a person faces the inconvenient truth, a new game starts. All of you guys here are facing that discomfort to help those in need."
Jumin,The RFA will always lead the way in facing the uncomfortable truth.
Jumin,This is all I have to say.
Jumin,"We’ve prepared champagne and treats for everyone, so please enjoy."
Jumin,The auction will start in two hours. Thank you.
Laptop,Decoding intelligence agency GIS complete. Attempting to infiltrate… 1st attempt…
Laptop,Mic check complete.
707,Mic on.
Laptop,Mic on. Please record after the beep.
707,"Ah ah- Is everyone alright? This is agent Seven! Zero! Seven! I’m still alive. Surprising, huh?"
707,"Hmm… Seeing that the server’s going crazy, I guess you hear my voice! Anyways, listen carefully. This is not a joke but a serious warning."
707,The person Mary Vanderwood 3rd kidnapped is not me. I am using the agency code 707 EXTREME as my full name and worked with client G-RACE 64 3 months ago.
707,The boss’ hair is actually a wig. Now you know that it’s me?
707,"The person that looks like me, Agent Vanderwood, is not me. If you touch a single hair on his body… I will reveal to the media all the information I took out from the agency system last night,"
707,"I know a lot of powerful people are involved. f you want to save your selves, tell Agent Vanderwood this."
707,To keep that boy safe… I’ll be there soon.
707,"I will send this recording to everyone’s email so check it. Then, since I’m sure you’re all trying to trace me, I’ll be off."
Laptop,Mic off.
707,Well… that’s over now.
707,"MC, listen to the radio. I’m sure you’ll get the RFA party signal."
Radio,"…they gathered the courage to go after the truth. Saeyoung Choi, and MC… We are very proud of them."
Radio,The RFA will always lead the way in facing the uncomfortable truth.
707,"Oh no, it’s almost over. And… he called my name."
707,"MC, it must have been so hard to prepare for the party. i’m sorry we have to miss it."
707,I feel so sad that we’re missing the party.
707,Let’s return to the RFA as soon as we finish this thing. Now with the truth in our hands… The RFA will begin again.
707,"I’m sure it will happen soon, and we’ll find Saeran too. I can feel it… He’s still alive."
707,Please think of this as our last time. Once we find Saeran… we¡ll never be in danger again.
707,Can I… ask you a favor?
707,now when you call me… please call me Saeyoung.
707,"My name… When I think of 707, I think of the fun me, away form the sad reality. It’s the happiest version of me, but it’s also fake."
707,"When I think of Luciel, I remember the hope V gave me. the hope that I can leave my past and everyone will be happy… but it was false hope."
707,"And the name Saeyoung… It reminds me of the hardest time, but it was the only truthful moment I had."
707,"Now I’ve left the agency, and I’ve left V. MC, when I’m with you… I want to live as the real me."
707,So please call me by my real name from now on.
707,"I shook in fear every time I heard someone called me by this name…. but every time you say it, it will be reborn as a name that only holds happiness."
Saeyoung,I’m so sorry… for making you suffer.
Saeyoung,My heart… has been yours for a long time now.
Saeyoung,I’ll prove it to you… I’ll be a happy Saeyoung with you.
